            "answer": "I am sorry not to introduce myself before posting but I am freaking out a bit.\u00a0\u00a0My name is Amy and I live in Michigan I have a long history of problems.\u00a0\u00a0My story is as follows:\u00a0\u00a0I have to break it up into two posts because it exceeds th 8000 character limit.I don't want to totally bore you but I have already written this out for my Doctor's appt. on Friday.A very short bio:I was born and Michigan in 1965.\u00a0\u00a0In 1979 I moved to Maryland after the divorce of my parents.\u00a0\u00a0In 1995 I moved back to Michigan to live closer to my sister.\u00a0\u00a0I am 45 years old, married with two young children.I have always had a significant amount of stress in my life.\u00a0\u00a0I grew up with a mother who suffered from mental illness and although not physically abused, I, along with my two siblings was verbally abused for many years.\u00a0\u00a0This abuse still continues when I am in contact with her.\u00a0\u00a0I was uprooted in my early teens to live with my father and the situation there was tense as well as he had started a new life with a new wife and child.\u00a0\u00a0I did not attend college as I was eager to move out of my father's house and begin my own life.I was alone and happy for the next six years until I met and married my husband in 1991.\u00a0\u00a0Our marriage has been extremely unhappy and stressful from the beginning.\u00a0\u00a0We remain married and have two children ages 10 and 11.\u00a0\u00a0My health has always taken a back seat and I come from a \"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\" family mentality so I dismissed a lot of things on factors I could control myself.It has been a long time since I have felt well and my memory is very poor.\u00a0\u00a0I have kept adequate health records and will list all aches, pains, surgeries and illnesses as I remember them and have documentation for.My medical history:Smoker from 1980 - 2001Birth Control Pills from 1981 - 1991Fibrocystic Breast Disease - 1987 - PresentHashimoto's Thyroiditis - 1993 - PresentIn 1993 I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis after two miscarriages.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to that the only health issue I had was fibrocystic breasts.\u00a0\u00a0I honestly don't know what actually came first and I had never heard of either.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on thyroid medication but never quite felt the same again.\u00a0\u00a0My main problems were muscle tightness and breast pain.In 1994 I had two bouts of blood in my urine.\u00a0\u00a0Not just traces of blood but urinating blood.\u00a0\u00a0There was never any infection found and no pain was involved.\u00a0\u00a0I had scans of my kidneys and usual tests for infections and was told all was normal.\u00a0\u00a0Both instances resolved on their own after about 10 days and have never returned.I became pregnant with my first child in March 1999.\u00a0\u00a0I was sick from day one and was hospitalized four weeks prior to my due date with preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0I weighed 115 lbs. when I became pregnant and was 200 lbs upon delivery.\u00a0\u00a0 I was induced three weeks early and delivery was normal vaginal delivery with epidural.As a new mother I was incredibly tired with a baby who never slept.\u00a0\u00a0I still worked full time and had my verbally abusive mother watch my young baby while I was at work.\u00a0\u00a0 The fatigue and stress was enormous.",

            "answer": "Amy's history continued:In 2000, history repeated itself again with another unplanned pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0The result of the pregnancy were the same with preeclampsia and a slightly premature infant.\u00a0\u00a0I was sleeping on average two to three hours nightly, still working and dealing with my abusive mother and disappearing marriage.As I write this it sounds so depressing but I was never felt\u00a0\u00a0depressed.\u00a0\u00a0I always was and still am a very intrinsically happy person.\u00a0\u00a0I was and am very tired due to lack of sleep but never irritable or depressed.I always managed to do what was necessary to keep myself and household under control and was always a happy mother.\u00a0\u00a0I see depression in both my siblings and have been around mental illness all my life so I know about depression.\u00a0\u00a0I have never felt depressed.\u00a0\u00a0I love life and remain very happy in spite of all that I have been through.In 2004 I remember wanting to take control of feeling better.\u00a0\u00a0I had gained so much weight and because I suffered from insomnia, I binged on sugar daily to keep awake.\u00a0\u00a0I weighed 155 lbs. and believed all my problems were due to a thyroid imbalance but could never find a doctor to agree.\u00a0\u00a0I was treated based on test results not on symptoms.Around this same time 2004-2005 I began to experience pain in both my feet.\u00a0\u00a0It felt as if my shoes were too tight.\u00a0\u00a0I know now this is neuropathy but at the time I didn't know what is was called.\u00a0\u00a0I kept buying different shoes but nothing made it better.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my PCP and he did a glucose test that turned out normal and then said he didn't know what it was and to use orthotics and lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0This terrible burning tightness went on for three years.In the spring of 2005 I was driving down the road feeling fine when I had sudden acute bladder pain.\u00a0\u00a0This pain has been the single most painful event of my life.\u00a0\u00a0I was close to home and instead of driving to the emergency room, I went home to lay on the floor for two days of constant pain.\u00a0\u00a0I found some old Darvacet in the cabinet and lived off that until I could stand upright long enough to seek help.\u00a0\u00a0I began to have constant pain to the point of avoiding tampons and sexual intercourse because of the pain.\u00a0\u00a0I began urinating every 20 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0Although it was not painful to urinate, there was a constant pain.\u00a0\u00a0I saw my Gynecologist who found no infection and referred me to a urologist.\u00a0\u00a0The Urologist tested for infection and looked inside my bladder and found nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I can't stress enough the significance of this in my life.\u00a0\u00a0For the next five years, I was urinating between 40 - 70 times per day and about four times nightly.\u00a0\u00a0The pain persisted but it was not as severe as the initial \"attack\".\u00a0\u00a0Again, I sought answers to no avail.In July 2006 I was standing in ankle deep in a cold swimming pool and my big toe on my left foot kept pulling upward.\u00a0\u00a0The sensation was uncomfortable so I stayed out of the water.\u00a0\u00a0I now know this is a Babinski reflex but at the time I did not know what the reflex was.In 2007, I went on a benefit walk and noticed I was limping.\u00a0\u00a0My legs felt stiff and I could not finish the three mile walk.\u00a0\u00a0I put off seeking help for this until July of 2008 when my limp did not go away.\u00a0\u00a0My PCP told me it was sciatica but sent me for an emg.\u00a0\u00a0In July 2008 I was told I had a pinched nerve and needed physical therapy.\u00a0\u00a0I could not afford physical therapy so I printed out some exercises I found on the Internet and did them with no resolution.\u00a0\u00a0I developed Plantar Fasciitis in my left foot that I could not get rid of until 2009.\u00a0\u00a0Very painful.In October of 2007, I took my kids trick-or-treating and barely made it home. (About one mile).\u00a0\u00a0My walking was stiff and uncomfortable and I was still limping.Halloween 2008 - Same problem,\u00a0\u00a0a little worse, but I did make it home.In the\u00a0\u00a0late summer - early fall of 2008 I was living on no sleep because of insomnia, still eating poorly, battling frequent urination, limping and suffering with painful feet.\u00a0\u00a0I then woke up one morning and noticed the left side of my face was drooping badly.\u00a0\u00a0Mostly my mouth.\u00a0\u00a0The first thing that came to my mind was a stroke.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed my left arm was weak.\u00a0\u00a0I wasn't sure if this had been ongoing and just pronounced on that day because I was so exhausted or an \"event\" that had occurred during the night.\u00a0\u00a0I neglected the incident all together and went to work.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed as the day went on my face was off but I felt okay.\u00a0\u00a0From this point on, I noticed my typing speed was off on my left side.\u00a0\u00a0I could still type two handed only slower than I had been.In January of 2009 I had my first leg spasm.\u00a0\u00a0It was an extensor spasm in both my legs at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0It would happen infrequently when I laid on my back only.\u00a0\u00a0I also started to become aware of my cognitive decline.\u00a0\u00a0I blamed this on insomnia too.\u00a0\u00a0Simple math or spelling was a challenge and I constantly was forgetting simple tasks.\u00a0\u00a0This continues to this day.In May 2009 I saw an Orthopedic Doctor who ordered x-rays of my spine.\u00a0\u00a0He also ordered a MRI of my neck and lumbar spine.\u00a0\u00a0He told me I had some cervical spine problems but not enough to cause my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0He told me my basically spine was fine and I should see a Neurologist.The next month, June 2009, I saw my first Neurologist who performed blood work and standard office test for reflexes, eye movements, etc.\u00a0\u00a0He said all was normal and to see a Rheumatologist.\u00a0\u00a0He said my Lupus test was normal and did not have an answer to my stiffness and limp.In July 2009, I went to a new Endocrinologist about lower leg pain I was having.\u00a0\u00a0Blood tests revealed low vitamin D.\u00a0\u00a0I was told my thyroid was normal.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on vitamin D but pain did not go away.\u00a0\u00a0My leg pain became increasingly worse and at this point I really new something was terribly wrong but I didn't know where to seek treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I knew I was losing strength on my left side and also my ability to walk.\u00a0\u00a0I also noticed I would wake up a couple of nights weekly with uncontrolled shivering or night sweats.\u00a0\u00a0My body could not regulate my temperature.November 2009, I went to a Rheumatologist who was able to see I had neurological deficits.\u00a0\u00a0He was able to elicit a Babinki sign on my left foot and said i had Hyperreflexia and Spasticity. He said to go back to the Neurologist for further evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0When I asked him about my muscle pain he said I had Fibromyalgia and gave me a prescription of Flexeril.\u00a0\u00a0I asked if it could be my thyroid and he said no.\u00a0\u00a0I took a Flexeril and it made me very loopy so I never took one again.December 2009, I went back to the original Neurologist who ordered a MRI of my brain and a SSEP Test.\u00a0\u00a0Both were normal.\u00a0\u00a0He prescribed baclofen for my spasticity.",

            "answer": "At this point I was getting weaker and could not hold much weight with my left hand.\u00a0\u00a0My leg was dragging and my anxiety was increasing fast.\u00a0\u00a0I started taking vitamins including a lot of vitamin B.\u00a0\u00a0Almost immediately my frequent urination stopped.\u00a0\u00a0After 5 years, I was back to normal urinary frequency.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if it was the vitamins or not but I am completely normal as far as my bladder goes.\u00a0\u00a0??In March of 2010, my mother recommended I go see a physiatrist.\u00a0\u00a0I did.\u00a0\u00a0He said I could have thoracic outlet syndrome and ordered a cervical and thoracic MRI.\u00a0\u00a0At this time I began having widespread fasciculations.\u00a0\u00a0When my MRI's were normal, I was convinced I had ALS.\u00a0\u00a0The same doctor gave me an emg that was normal.\u00a0\u00a0I was still concerned about ALS because I now had both upper and lower motor neuron signs and had lost most function in my left hand and arm along with foot drop.\u00a0\u00a0I could see the muscle between my thumb and forefinger was atrophied and I had lots of visible fasciculations.The Physiatrist sent me to the U of M in Ann Arbor where I had lots of blood drawn.\u00a0\u00a0I was unimpressed with the Doctor not giving me a complete neurological exam and looking at my left hand/leg.\u00a0\u00a0At this time, I could not walk without tennis shoes on as I could gain no traction nor could I raise my left arm over my head.In July 2010, I gave up on the U of M and went to an ALS specialist at the Detroit Medical Center in Detroit.\u00a0\u00a0He saw my motor deficits and agreed I may have ALS because I had no sensory symptoms and normal MRI's.\u00a0\u00a0He scheduled an emg/nerve conduction that he attended and supervised.\u00a0\u00a0The tests were normal and said I most likely had Primary Lateral Sclerosis because the emg did not detect lower motor neuron problems.\u00a0\u00a0He referred me to the other ALS specialist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit.In December 2010 I had another emg/nerve conduction done by the Henry Ford ALS director Dr. Newman.\u00a0\u00a0This test was normal.\u00a0\u00a0He said while looking over my MRI record, there was something seen on my brain stem MRI.\u00a0\u00a0He ordered a spinal tap.In March 2011, I had a spinal tap.\u00a0\u00a0The results of the spinal tap were four or more oligoclonal bands.\u00a0\u00a0The ALS doctor called and he said I did not have ALS but most likely Primary Progressive MS.\u00a0\u00a0He referred me to the Henry Ford MS specialist.The Henry Ford MS specialist ordered more MRI's of my brain and full spine.\u00a0\u00a0She said I had Primary Progressive MS and told me there was no treatment.\u00a0\u00a0She gave me a booklet about MS and said to come back in four months.After my series of MRI's, the Henry Ford MS secretary called to tell me that there is a lesion on my brain stem and C1 cervical spine but I did not meet the criteria for MS.\u00a0\u00a0I assumed this was the McDonald criteria.\u00a0\u00a0My MS diagnosis was revoked.\u00a0\u00a0I was told to keep repeating MRI's every so often to look for more lesions.In May 2011, I went to my PCP to see what he thought and he said I had a lot of problems for having one lesion.\u00a0\u00a0He told me I could go to Mayo Clinic but because I have\u00a0\u00a0had pretty extensive testing already, he thought the expense of Mayo may just have the same outcome of possible MS.\u00a0\u00a0I asked him about putting me on Low Dose Naltrexone for Inflammation, Hashimoto's....... He said he had not heard of it and would not prescribe it nor could I obtain a prescription for Natural Thyroid, Armour, etc.I went to the Internet because of Tendonitis and Plantar Fasciitis of now my right foot.\u00a0\u00a0I read about eliminating gluten and learned about Lyme being common and often misdiagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0I did eliminate gluten and had my blood drawn for Lyme.\u00a0\u00a0I grew up in a wooded area and was always outside.\u00a0\u00a0I was bitten by a few ticks as a child but never remember any rash.As of today, I can only walk a short distance unaided. I have lost most use of my left arm and hand, I have uninterrupted memory and cognitive problems, joint pain, muscle pain, leg pain due to spasticity, and foot pain. I also have moderate light sensitivity, cyclical fibrocystic breasts,\u00a0\u00a0general weakness and overall malaise.I remain undiagnosed.My IGenex Results are:Lyme IGM Western Blot:Igenex - PositiveCDC/NYS - Negative18 kDa +**23-25 kDa -23 kDa -30 kDa -**31 kDa IND**34 kDa -**39 kDa IND**41 kDa ++45 kDa +58 kDa +66 kDa -**83-93 kDa ++Lyme IgG Western Blot:Igenex - NegativeCDC/Nys Result - Negative18 kDa -**23-25 kDa -23 kDa -30 kDa -**31 kDa IND**34 kDa -**39 kDa IND**41 kDa +45 kDa -58 kDa -66 kDa -**83-93 kDa -IFA, B Burgdoferi - Result 40Equivocal",

            "answer": "Briefly,The starred (***) are the ones which most specifically refer to Lyme so those are important to look at.Igenex is a laboratory that runs the tests and gives its interpretaton, then it will also give the interpretation that the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) uses -- the CDC uses a higher standard, which Lyme docs believe ignores too many people who actually have Lyme.\u00a0\u00a0(The CDC set its standards for epidemiological purposes long ago, trying to track absolute, certain, slamdunk cases of Lyme, but those very high standards have more recently been used by nonLyme specialists for diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0That means a lot of people truly ill with Lyme are excluded by CDC standards.)IgM results test for the antibodies your immune system makes shortly after infection; IgG antibodies are made after a period of time when the IgM reaction is fading.\u00a0\u00a0There is no specific time cut off on which one fades and the other leaps up.The 'double starred' (**) bands are the ones most important to a Lyme diagnosis.If you go to truthaboutlymedisease [dot] com, there is a post from 2009 that lays out what each band means.On your IgM results, on the double-starred bands:**23-25 kDa -**31 kDa IND\u00a0\u00a0 ===>\u00a0\u00a0\"IND\" means 'indeterminate' meaning 'maybe', but this is an important one, because if you have this, only Lyme would make this band light up (it is 'specific' to Lyme)**34 kDa -**39 kDa IND\u00a0\u00a0 ===> this is also specific to Lyme**41 kDa ++\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0===>\u00a0\u00a0could be Lyme, could be something else**83-93 kDa ++\u00a0\u00a0===> also specific to LymeHOWEVER\u00a0\u00a0what is important to remember is that the tests are very imperfect, and they are used only to ASSIST in diagnosis, not to MAKE the diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Like a pregnancy test:\u00a0\u00a0it may be negative, but if your stomach gets big and you're getting kicked from the inside, you're pretty surely pregnant no matter what the test says.Let us know how you do after you see your doc --",
