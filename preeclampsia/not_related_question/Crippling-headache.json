            "answer": "I had horrible headaches with my first pregnancy from my 20th week. They were mostly on the back right side and were completely debilitating. Soon after I developed lower back pain beyond anything I have ever experienced. I thought it was hormonal or a kidney infection, but at 30 weeks I went to the hospital and they found out I had HELLP syndrome. A sever form of preeclampsia. I do not think you have HELLP as you did not mention any back pain or gastrointestinal pain, but I let my headaches be chalked up to hormones and should have spoken up.My only thought is that if they persist I would make sure they test you for EVERYTHING. My OB was an idiot and blew me off and it resulted in mismanaged care, and a way too early deilvery.It very well could behormonal, but the pain you describe seems unbearable, as was mine. I felt there was something off with me too and finally took action. Do you have loss of appetite or just generally feel fluish??If you would liek more information, let me know....",

    "question": "I had the worst headache (by at least 4 times over anything else I've ever felt) last night... It started about 4:30 in the afternoon and gradually built to a pretty bad migraine, one of my worst... I tried everything there is to try... hot, cold, tylenol, protein, carb, caffeine, copious amounts of water (sometimes I get dehydrated), darvocet... then i researched and thought maybe it was lack of iron... i didn't know there was so much that could interefere with it's absorption (can't take it with milk, or with caffeine, can't take it with antacids, etc)...So I took an iron capsule... after a little less than an hour, it started to feel some better.\u00a0\u00a0So at 2am I made it to bed and it finally didn't hurt to lie down.At 4am, I woke up to pain like I've never known.\u00a0\u00a0It was worse than labor.\u00a0\u00a0It was worse than the car accident.\u00a0\u00a0It was worse than anything I've ever felt... And for the first time in my life i was scared I was going to die.This goes beyond \"pregnancy migraine\"... something has to be wrong... I don't know what.\u00a0\u00a0But something just isn't right... I kept having, on top of the general excruciating pain, a funny twitching pain on the lower portion of the back of my head, just to the left of center, and it sort of would shoot upward... it was really scary.Does any of this trigger any ideas or memories or thoughts for any of you?\u00a0\u00a0Please tell me if it does---even if you think it can't be it or is hair-brained... I've got to find answers.\u00a0\u00a0I can't just risk this being a bloodclot or something, I have a 7 year old boy, he needs me---my partner needs me.If you can think of anything, please share it.\u00a0\u00a0It has subsided into a low throb right now, but I know it's coming back, since it's not all gone yet.- Jess",
