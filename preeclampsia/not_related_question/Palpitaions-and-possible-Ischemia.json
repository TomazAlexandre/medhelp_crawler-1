            "answer": "It's normal to have palpitations and shortness of breath during pregnancy but some conditions such as preeclampsia (HTN) or diabetes should be ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0Your obgyn should take care of that.\u00a0\u00a0I am assuming that you were healthy prior to the pregnancy and that the first pregnancy was uncomplicated.\u00a0\u00a0EKG readouts made by the machine are ofter wrong, we as cardiologist correct them all the time.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, an obgyn is no EKG expert and he or she should ask a cardiologist or an internal medicine doctor if they aren't sure what they are looking at.\u00a0\u00a0My hunch is that your EKG, even though it may be slightly abnormal, is no reason to be concerned.\u00a0\u00a0I am not concerned about ischemia or coronary artery disease in your case.\u00a0\u00a0Palpitations are very common during pregnancy and as long as there is no sustained arrhythmia you will be ok.\u00a0\u00a0The last term means that those extra beats are going on continuously for minutes to hours, non-stop.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, if the exertional shortness of breath or the palpitations worsen I would recommend that you seek further workup but let your obgyn guide it, they have lots of experience dealing with this.\u00a0\u00a0.",

            "answer": "Yes I was healthy prior to my first pregnancy and it was uncomplicated.\u00a0\u00a0And so far this pregnancy is also.\u00a0\u00a0My palps started during my first pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0After I had my son they continued and never went away and it also consists of the shortness of breath especially when I am not resting and moving around alot.\u00a0\u00a0I have had them for 3 years now off and on sometimes several times a day, few weekly, or sometimes not for a month or so.\u00a0\u00a0One was so strong a few months ago it felt like a squeezing sensation and it felt fluidy.\u00a0\u00a0My allergist said that it didnt make sense to him and didnt sound like asthma is causeing the symptoms like he was treating me for originally.\u00a0\u00a0So thats when he sent me for an EKG and I followed up with my OBGYN with it.\u00a0\u00a0WHat do you mean by the last term means that those extra beats are going on continuously for minutes or hours non-stop?\u00a0\u00a0By the last term do you mean Ischemia and that it just means that my palps are continuous?",
