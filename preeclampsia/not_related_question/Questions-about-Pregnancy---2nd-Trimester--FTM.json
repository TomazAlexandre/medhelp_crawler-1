            "answer": "All of those are signs of preeclampsia so you should seek medical help as soon as possible. I would say go to the ER. At the least it could just be caused by high blood pressure. I had the same symptoms and was sent to the ER. Fortunately is was just high bp and was prescribed meds to help control it, but I am now labeled high risk because of the elevated bp and increased risk of developing preeclampsia later. I would say go to the ER. Better to be safe than sorry!",

I only got maybe a total of 3-4 bad head aches when I was in my second trimester. The blurred vision I would get it seemed if I was standing for a long time, sometimes it would come and go. And my cramps I was told was just normal growing pains. Like I said though everyone is different, I also started seeing the obgyn at 7 weeks and so on. I would just try and make an appointment for as soon as you possibly can at your new obgyn office.",
