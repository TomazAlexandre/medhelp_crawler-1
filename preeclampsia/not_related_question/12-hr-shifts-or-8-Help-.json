    "question": "Do you think it is better to work 12 hr shifts 2 days then off 2 then work 3 one week then the next week off 2 days work 2 days then off 3 days or work 8 hr shifts& b off way less? Idk the 12 hr days kill me! But I remember how tired I was when I wasn't pregnant& working 8 hr days. I can keep my 12's or go back to 8 hr days I figured 8 hr days would b better once the baby was born because it would b less time at the daycare. HELP! PLEASE!",
