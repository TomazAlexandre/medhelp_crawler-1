    "question": "Today I am 15 weeks- meaning next week I will be 4 months! How is everyone feeling? A couple of questions. If I had an ultrasound done before my 20 week apt. could they find out the sex? My sickness was SO bad as I had hyperglycemia or whatever up until right after I hit the second trimester so I feel so much better- basically no nausea. I am a heavier set mama so eager to know when I can feel kicks and stuff. I have been laying on my belly a lot during sleep and was told its okay and that I will know when to stop doing that, but how? lol.",
