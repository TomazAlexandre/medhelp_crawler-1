Waiting when baby is ready is best bet.. I am 37 weeks now with my little one and this time I will deaf wait things out",

            "answer": "i was 42 + a few days when i was induced...does getting induced hurt??No being induced is just the medical intervention to start labor when that naturally doesn't happen usually using an IV to give Pitocin which is a drug that is supposed to stimulate the uterus to contract..This drug does however make contraction more intense but that does not mean that happens to everyone that is just the over view of what its supposed to be like... im my situation i was induced because my body wouldn't go into labor on its own and i was medically getting to far along that it could of caused complications with the baby..\u00a0\u00a0i was first given a Pitocin bulb which is a dissolvable capsule they put on your cervix with Pitocin in it which is supposed to help stimulate your cervix to start labor.. then i was given and IV with Pitocin which caused contractions...because my body reacted so badly to labor i asked for an epidural to force relaxation and allow the natural process to be able to take place...once i was finally relaxed i had VERY short active labor and pushed for 10 mins and had my daughter....i have chosen to go as long as medically possible with this one as well , before being induced. Depending on the doctor they will only induce or C-section when they absolutely HAVE to but like i said that's a doctor to doctor basis...just breath and take one step at a time..being induced is not a scary process just make sure if you are scared to ask questions till you feel comfortable with whats being done :)",
