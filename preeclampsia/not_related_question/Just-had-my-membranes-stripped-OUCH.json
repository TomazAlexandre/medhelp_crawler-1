            "answer": "Membrane stripping is the 'naturel' procedure they use for starting labour. Its not like being induced where they admit you to the hospital and give you the drip and the gel. Instead its a 5 minute procedure my midwife performed at my appt. today.Basically she inserts 1 or 2 fingers inside your cervix and stretches around the bag of waters to try and 'loosen' it away from the cervix. The action is supposed to make my body release the oxytocin hormone which starts labour.Theres no guarentee on its effectivness and it bloody hurts alot! i nearly cried. I had it done about 10 hours ago now and ive been alot more crampy than before and my vagina feels alittle tender. If nothing else happens i have to have it done again next week, this time by the doctor. Which freaks me out abit as i find the docs more rough than the midwives!!Its optional to have it done and works for some and does absolutely nothing for others.. but at this point im willing to try anything!If anything happens ill let you know!!",

It can take up to a few times to work (if it does) so you can get it done when your 37-38 weeks to try and reduce the possibility of being over due.\u00a0\u00a0The doc will only do it if he thinks your ready for labour and if its suitable?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Has your midwife/ doc never discussed this with you?",
