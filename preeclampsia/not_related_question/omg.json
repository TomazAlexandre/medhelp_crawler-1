But I spent a lot of time in and out of hospital getting checked having stress tests ultrasounds blood work had nurses coming to the house all the time and had to see my Dr once a week.

My first little guy was very sick at birth he ended up having surgery but they sad there was no way to know if that was from the hp. I also had other health issues while pregnant. My second was born perfectly healthy no issues at all.",
