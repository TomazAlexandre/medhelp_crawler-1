In 2003 I had a full blood work (due to other circumstances) and everything was normal. In 2006 I had 2 m/c-es in a row and in Sept of 2006 the blood tests revieled that I have AT3 deficiency (kind of BCD).I advise you to start threatment. 3 m/c-es is something a little unusal when everything is ok. I don't think it'll hurt to start something just in case.The name is beautiful. I never found out what I was having:(",

These complications may include stillbirth (pregnancy loss after week 20), second trimester pregnancy loss, placental abruption (where the placenta detaches from the uterus), and preeclampsia (elevated blood pressure that can lead to dangerous consequences). Some studies have also shown a relationship between a mother having the prothrombin mutation and delivering a baby of small size. At this time, it does seem that having the prothrombin mutation may increase the risk of these situations, but it is unclear how strong the association may be.",

I have been tested for everything possible until I miscarried my last one on 10/26,I changed doctors. I gave blood and tested with having MTHFR. I decided to start taking the baby aspirin and metformin before getting pregnant with this one and by the time the lab results came back positive having it. I was already a couple of weeks pregnant and I still continue to take the 81mg aspirin, progesterone, and metformin. No I did not know of my condition until recently.
