Go to bed and rest, avoid salty foods, stay hydrated. I had severe preeclamplsia and my bp was 170/140 and I pretty much did nothing in hospital, just lay around for a couple of days trying to get it down before they started me on bp meds. If you get the severe headache, seeing spots etc etc or just want reassurance, just go back and tell them its worse.",

They have ways of getting ahold of your doctor a lot faster than you could, so they might be willing to let you stay until you stabilize or deliver, whichever comes first. The nurses are not your enemy and usually advocate for you.",

Like I tried saying to them I'm 39 weeks and she's always measured big.. She's healthy. A lot of people are telling me to call a different hospital (I am lucky enough to have a few in the area). I just want to make sure we both are healthy and I'm afraid they aren't taking my symptoms very seriously .",
