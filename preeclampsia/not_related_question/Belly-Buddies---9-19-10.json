This time around I lucked out and got in with an OB early on so I got a seven week scan. My doc was super mad but oh well he wasn't listening to me and kept telling me I was going to miscarry this pregnancy even though everything was going well lol. After I have this baby I'm giving him another chance then if I'm still not happy with him I'm going to ask if I can switch over to his wife. It's almost impossible to switch soca here in Canada so that may be my only option.Anyhow sorry this is so long. 15 days until my due date and I'm getting nervous! All along I've thought my lol man was going to be early but it feels as if he disengaged the other day and has been flipping around in very odd positions so guess he's gonna be late now :( Braxton hicks are feeling like sharp pains now instead of menstrual like cramps.

Went to my OB appt yesterday and told her I thought baby may have disengaged but turns out he is well engaged :) More frequent contractions today but not strong enough for me to think its time yet.On a different note, Im freaking out because I tested positive for strep B and though the doc says Ill get treated with antibiotics and everything will be fine, I looked it up on the internet (bad bad bad!) and now Im really concerned about something happening to my little man. :(",

His oldest daughter is fine with the baby but the younger one is not happy about it and she has been pretty grumpy the last few weeks because she knows the time is going to be here any day now, and she's going to lose the \"baby\" status. :( Well at least were having a boy, so she will always be the \"baby girl\".Strep B is some sort of bacteria kind of like a yeast infection or bladder infection, its found naturally in about 25% of womens systems. I have to take antibiotics during labor to prevent the baby from being exposed to it. If he is, then it can have devastating side effects. Thats why I'm so scared. I live 45 mins away from the hospital and have already been worried about not getting there in time, and now I'm gonna have to make sure I'm there good and early I guess. I really shouldn't have looked on the internet because the risk is extremely low nowadays because of the use of the antibiotics, but of course we pregnant women like to google stuff and freak ourselves out lol.\u00a0\u00a0;p",
