            "answer": "my understanding of ablation was that it was the burning away of the uterine lining, leaving scar tissue which makes it difficult for the uterine linng to build back up, usually done as a remedy to heavy irregular periods in women who are through building their family.i would think the risk to the baby would be during the 1st trimester (which you may already be past) when implantation occurs and the placenta develops. Once the placenta takes over, I'd think the baby would be home free.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure what the risk to you would be, except they probably wouldn't let you deliver vaginally, due to risk of uterine rupture during labor from the scar tissue.I had a friend who had the ablation done. her doc told her it would be impossible to get pregnant in the next 10 years, that she probably wouldn't even have a period for quite a long while... guess I better tell her about you, huh? LOL.did they do your ablation for heavy periods, or was there some other reason?",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for replying to my post. Yes, they did mine for heavy periods, plus I was in so much pain to due to my periods. No, one is not to get pregnant after this, or at least thats what they told me. But you see my dr's was wrong. They are telling me now that I will be able to carry the baby, but still, I am scared to death. I go to have an ultrasound done on monday to see where the baby has planted itself. And to see what is instore for me then. Just tell your friend to use all the protection she can from getting pregnant, cause apparently, you can still get pregnant after an ablation. I was finished having my babies, thats why I had it done. I have 3 children. But you know, I have looked at it since I have gotten over the shock that it must have been the Lord's will, so I am looking at it that way, and if he wants me to carry the baby, then I will. That is the only way to look at this situation. I have put it all in his hands, but that dont meant I am not scared to death. Again thank you for replying to my post.Deanna",

            "answer": "FROM OB-GYN.NET:\"Ablation does NOT provide reliable birth control, since ovulation still takes place as before, and the uterine lining may be receptive to a pregnancy. Second, pregnancy in general should not be elected after an ablation; in fact, it can be dangerous. The procedure can cause changes in the uterus that make pregnancy potentially hazardous to the mother, including possible complications such as uterine rupture and placenta accreta (a placenta that becomes \"stuck\" to the uterus and cannot be removed, causing potentially life-threatening bleeding). Because of the potential problems with future pregnancies, it is generally recommended that reliable birth control, including male or female sterilization, be considered in women who undergo ablations.\"---------------------------------------------------------------Here is a paragraph from the book, A Gynecologist's Second Opinion: The Questions and Answers You Need to Take Charge of Your Health by William H. Parker, M.D., with Rachel L. Parker, Contributions by Ingrid A. Rodi, M.D. and Amy E. Rosenman, M.D:\"Once the lining cells of the uterus are destroyed by the procedure, there is no place for a developing fetus to attach within the uterus. If some cells remain following an ablation, there exists the rare possibility of pregnancy occuring. If pregnancy were to occur, termination would most likely be recommended as doctors are concerned that without adequate cells lining the inside of the uterus, the placenta would grow directly into the muscle wall of the uterus and take hold like the roots of a tree. As a result, the placenta would not be able to separate at the time of delivery, and hemorrhage could occur. This procedure is not a form of birth control and another method of birth control must still be used to avoid pregnancy.\"So it sounds like it can be very dangerous, still!",

We divorced not long after that. I am in a serious relationship with a man that has no children and is very capable of having them. I started taking birth control pills\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0. Now I bleed continuously. I hate it. He and I will probably marry some day soon. Not sure if I would want to take the risk of becoming pregnant. People will think I am nuts for even considering this. Would love to give him a child if that is something for us. Not sure what to do. Was wondering after your procedure, did you still have heavy periods? When I had this done I was told I had a very thick uterine wall. Wondering if that is why I still have heavy periods. I did go 77 days without a period at all. Doc said probably due to stress and weight loss. Not sure if I should just go and get a tubal ligation and be done with this whole thing.\u00a0\u00a0Would love some input from anyone....",

It took docs over 3 hours to remove my uterus because it feel into pieces when they were removing it........ This is due to the fact that ablation does hurt your uterus and it makes it hard to carry a baby to full term afterwards.Please look onto the novasure website to read up on the issues about this.Good luck.There is another post regarding ablation on here, you might want to look at it cause there are over 100 posts on it.",

You may think i'm crazy I had my tubes tied 7yrs. ago and had my oblation 5months ago and didn't realize until talking to my husband of 19yrs. a few weeks ago that we really want another child. My cycle never stopped after the oblation it only took 2 months for the bleeding to get back to normal but I have no cramps at all. Thank God for that. We really want one more child. I have heard of a reverse tubal but I didn't know the risk of a pregnacy after a oblation or the slight chance of getting pregnant. I remember my doctor telling me that since a had my tubes tied that I didn't want any more children when he suggested the oblation and I agreed because at the time I hadn't thought about it but he never went into detail that if I ever changed my mind that I couldn't get pregnant.I think I know what stirred up all the emotions of us having another baby. Our first grandchild which was a boy was a still born about a month ago. We were so excited and had so many plans. Now they are talking about waiting a couple of years before trying again. I don't know maybe it's for the best if we can't but we sure do want to. My youngest is really getting big and I didn't realize that the baby stage would be over after awhile because we always had 1 little one on the end.If anyone understands or have any suggestions please comment.

Ive read all your posts and im so glad you were able to carry your baby. I have NovaSure done in April of 07 and I just found out last friday im pregnant. My first emotions were terrified and upset with myself that I let this happen. Im almost 37, I have 5 healthy children and had 5 eneventful pregnancies. Although my bleeding was much less after the procedure I had a period every month on a regular cycle. I called my Ob that did the procedure first thing Mon. morning and he didnt even ask to see me. Told me to terminate the pregnancy and referred me to an abortion clinic.He said my chances of everything being ok were less than 5 percent. I had already come to terms with the fact that I would more than likely have to have an abortion, I do not want to risk my life and leave my other children without a mother. I called and made an appt for the abortion but im only 5 weeks and I have to be at least 6 so I have to wait. I think that is torture for any woman. The longer I know im pregnant and I feel pregnant the harder the thought of terminating it gets. Im in a relationship with a wonderful man who i love with all my heart. He has no children of his own and didnt want any but loves my kids to death. Now that im pregnant and the thought that we will have to terminate it he has uncovered feelings he didnt think he had not to mention he is strongly against abortion. I decided to look on the internet for high risk Doctors in my area and only one came up so I made a phone call. I talked to a high risk nurse who talked to the high risk Doctors and called me back and they thought I should definitely be seen and get a second opinion by someone before I do anything. They referred me to a Dr that is a little closer to me than they are.So now im waiting for a call to schedule a consult. I do not want to get my hopes up and unless I can get someone to say I have a really good chance of getting through this successfully I wont keep it on a less than 5 percent chance. I do know though that if I at least didnt see someone I would always have that in the back of my mind...what if everything would have been ok and I terminated for nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I have been constantly looking online and reading stories, both good and bad. there just isnt a lot out there. I appreciate you keeping people posted throughout. Ive noticed like a lot of other women that people tend to drop off and it leave us wondering what happened.What did your doctor say when you found out you were pregnant? And that mass you passed in the middle of the night..what do they think that was?",

At the time I had it done I thought I was all done having children as I was married and my hubsband had a vas. Well we seperated and I am now with the love of my life whom doesn't ahve any children of his own and we desperately want to have a child. I went to my family dr adn he told me that if I am still shedding a lining that I should have enough there to concieve but since he didn't know much about it he refered me to an OB}GYN\u00a0\u00a0to see what he had to say,Well I seen him the other day and he was very rude with me about even considering to be pregnant after having the MEA done. I explained my situation to him and told him how important this was to us and we knew the risks and were willing to take the chance since being on here and seeing so many positive stories. I am otherwise healthy and I am not really overly concerned about a serious problem occuring. I am scheduled to have pelvic ultra sounds done and a dye test done to make sure that my tubes are not blocked with scar tissue,I have to have blood tests done on day 3 and day 21 of my cycle to see if I am ovulating as I was always on time with my cycle until the past few months but I think its just my self stressing about things messing me up and I already had a bunch of blood tests done the day I seen him. He over all told me that I would probably get pregnant again but he would prefer that it wasn't while under his care until he was certian that all was well with me so that nothing could come back on him if something went wrong. I go back and see him in august if my family dr suggests it where he was so rude to me to get my results.if not I will be refered to a different dr who is willing to work with me in a positive manor.I will keep you all up to date with what is going on with me:)",

I never imagined I would be divorced and remarried so in 1998 I had my tubes tied and in 2006 I had an ablation via Novasure done. My new Husband and I want a baby but I just feel that this is not possible. I have been talking with the Chapel Hill tubal Reversal and they said by my OP notes I should have no problem with the reversal, the problem is the ablation. They said if I am not having periods then I probably do not have sufficient lining to support a pregnancy. Some months I have some pink on the TP some moths I have nothing and some I have not a whole lot but a day or two where I have a small amount of bleeding. Does this tissue grow back? I see there are some of you with a pregnancy after an ablation. I did have anemia with my very heavy periods so I had to do something but now I regret EVER having it done. if it were not for that I could have the TR and probably have a baby, now I am not even sure that is possible. I am still thinking of having the TR done in hopes that even with the ablation it is possible. Any advice from anyone or how can I stimulate the re-growth of my lining?",

            "answer": "I'm back to give an update!\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday afternoon I went to the my doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I had initiated the visit and the transvaginal ultrasound and sonogram.\u00a0\u00a0I wanted to see the condition of my uterus 9 months post-op.\u00a0\u00a0Ladies I am happy to report that 5 months after my doctor telling me to forget about having a child I am thrilled to say that I have been given the green light!!\u00a0\u00a0And for those of you who don't feel like going to back to look at my desperate and sad post in April of this year - I had Novasure in December 07 because of terrible painful periods. I was 36 and thought I was done having children. Right after the procedure I met the man of my dreams and we wanted very much to have a child of our own.\u00a0\u00a0I went to see my doctor in March and he said to forget about getting pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0It was awful.\u00a0\u00a0AWFUL!My uterus has completely regenerated itself - 8 days into my cycle I have an 8mm lining which is completely normal.\u00a0\u00a0My uterus is plump and healthy.\u00a0\u00a0I am still only having very light periods though (2 days of spotting).\u00a0\u00a0My doc told me that if he hadn't done the ablation himself (in Dec 07) he would have never known I had it done.\u00a0\u00a0I've never seen my doctor look or act the way he did yesterday - HE was glowing.\u00a0\u00a0I think he was shocked and amazed and sincerely happy to me (us).\u00a0\u00a0The positive energy coming from him amazing.Although my doc told me he thinks this was all a coincedence he told me that he would never tell anyone to underestimate the power of the mind.\u00a0\u00a0I think it was that but mostly Gods will.But I will tell you what I did that I know played an important role in all of this - and that is my lifestyle - both before and after the procedure.\u00a0\u00a0My healthy lifestyle has finally proven itself!!\u00a0\u00a0:)\u00a0\u00a0First - I DO NOT SMOKE.\u00a0\u00a0Second - I have an extremely healthy diet (whole grains, lots of green leafy veggies such as KALE and fresh dark green salads with veggies, lots of fresh berries everyday - rassberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries,. and soy bean \"edamame\" - organic whenever possible and affordable).\u00a0\u00a0I do not eat **** such as fried foods, overprocessed food, junk food, sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Third - I take 400IU of Vitamin E everyday along with a multi-vitamin.\u00a0\u00a0And the last thing - starting in July I started taking 3000mg of BROMELAIN per day (3 seperate doses on an EMPTY stomach) for the first two weeks of my cycle.\u00a0\u00a0Bromelain can help thicken the uterine lining.\u00a0\u00a0You do not want to take this more than 2 weeks at the beginning.\u00a0\u00a0There was a lot of research involved on my part with regards to Bromelain.\u00a0\u00a0All I can tell you is that after one go around with Bromelain I started having RED blood instead of pink blood during my \"periods\".We have an appointment with an IVF doctor Sept. 8.\u00a0\u00a0I'll update everyone then!Good luck to everyone!\u00a0\u00a0There IS hope!!",

I am only at 5 weeks, so the dr did an u/s assuming he wouldn't see anything. He saw a little \"pea\" in my uterus and thought that might be the baby.We did bloodwork and my HGC came back 1776\u00a0\u00a0(hooray!) and my progesterone 21.5.He also called teh company that makes the HTA (Hydrothermal ablasion which is the type I had), and they had never heard of anyone getting pregnant! So between my doctor, my past doctor, and this company, I am the only one they know of getting pregnant. He said within the next 7 to 10 days, we should be able to get a heart beat.I don't want to get too excited this early, but I really feel like this is a miracle from God!Jennie, I'm happy to hear you are doing so well, and also that your specialist has delivered healthy babies this way!",

My reversal I had done they said is a high success rate, only thing with the ablation is i would need an u/s to measure the thickness of my lining, if i chose to have that done, but they do not require it. I am goin to have the reversal done as soon as we save the money and just home god takes over the rest! I did not realize so many women getting pregnant after an ablation until after i came upone this site. I just wonder if there are more women who had an ablation who are either on birth control or had there tubes tied and that is why there are not more pregnancies with the procedure then there are. I had the novasure in 2006 but i am starting to have very light 1 day spotting return. I have read that if you have it done in you r early thirties the linig has a more chance of regenerating and periods return then if you had it done at a later age.",

I am with you Holly (Hellodian) It is hard to advise anyone to try to get pregnanct after ablation. A pregnancy can always have complications resulting in tragedy but from what you read a pregnancy after ablation increases those risks GREATLY!!! I have a very strong faith though and I believe that God has his own plan for each of us and that is the only thing that keeps me from spinning out of control like Taz! I have always had fertility problems, then was eclamptic with my first child and had preeclampsia with my two youngest spent many weeks on bed rest. Delivered my first at 32wks, 2nd at 35wks and my 3rd at 36wks. So I already realize that I will be hit with a double edged sword if I carry this baby.\u00a0\u00a0Now I am 9 wks pregnant and scared as HELL!!\u00a0\u00a0Maybe this will be my first flawless unactive pregnancy!!!\u00a0\u00a0My hubby decided we should tell our girls I dont know if it was the right thing to do or not but its done. We live in a small farm community and have always been very involved so everyone knows our children-my middle one spread the word very fast at the football game tonight.\u00a0\u00a0It is so hard for me though because we have known all these people are whole lives they have watched us grow and our girls grow since birth and have always givin us a hard time about a boy! (My hubby was our big all state QB, all state Basketball, blah, blah, blah WE have been together since his mom babysit me at age 4) So everyone is so excited and praying for a boy and I am just praying I carry this baby and it does not kill one of us!!\u00a0\u00a0How do I handle that situation?\u00a0\u00a0These folks have all taken care of my family while I was down with the other pregnancy so they are just expecting me to be down a while and give them another baby to spoil and watch grow.\u00a0\u00a0It is very hard for me to deal with.\u00a0\u00a0I am just trying to stay positive!!

I have been trying to do research on Ablation for so long and this is the first time that I have found any information at all that is even remotly helpful. You all have given me so much hope. I already have three children and am only 28 years old. I had an extremely bad divorce. I have been with my now fiance for four years. We will be married in April. This seems to be a very common problem but he has no children. I know how badly he wants a baby. He treats my three as his own but I know that it is different. I had an endometrial ablation in '06. I want to be able to give my fiance a child so desperatly. He will not even let me discuss it with him because of his fear of the dangers. (I am going to have him read these posts). After I had my first child I had surgery to remove cancer on my cervix. I was told that I would NEVER have anymore children. I had two more gorgious healthy babies. When I was pregnat with my daughter (my youngest) I kept telling the doctors that there was something wrong with her heart. I have no idea how I knew this, I just felt it. Throughout my pregnancy and even after she was born they listened to me only lightly and kept an eye on her heart. When she was four years old she had heart surgery. She is healthy and wonderful now. And now, I can't explain it but I KNOW that I can have another child. Even after the Endometrial Ablation. I'm sure that I can have another one, I just feel it. Any advice or concerns anybody else can share with me? For those of you that have become pregnant after the procedure was it worth it to you? I guess my ONLY fear would be a doctor trying to talk me into an abortion. I am 100% absolutly against abortion. Honostly, if a doctor told me tomarrow that I would die if I did not have this abortion then I would go home with my child still in the womb and hold all three of my babies very tightly tell them how much I love them and pray very hard. I would NEVER have an aboriton. Your stories of having children after ablation are very uplifting. My doctors never fully discussed any complications of getting pregnant or anythign they just basically said that I should take a birth control to prevent it (which I never have). Thank you all for your stories.",

My husband is very worried as well :o( This forum has already brought some peace of mind. Thank you all for sharing your intimate stories with the world.

They might have to do this through INV if at all. They also offer a shared-risk plan for qualifying patients. If you have not heard of this, it is where they offer you 50-100% of you money back if you do not have a live birth or if conception fails... but again you have to meet certain criteria to qualify..

I truly believe this pregnancy is meant to be and meant to make it to the end with a beautiful baby born :o) I knew when I got the procedure done what my chances were. However, those chances were higher than a hysterectomy. I always wanted another one. I was so sad when I had to do this. At the same time, I knew even if my chances were only 1% it was better then none. And here I am :o) It's truthful God is a miracle maker. My son for a VERY sick baby when he was born. Doc's said he would never do anything. He's now 12 walking, talking and living a VERY normal 12 yr old life. Is it so much to ask for another? I figure he knows what he wants for us. He is the reason we have these babies. ANd through it all, I pray he keeps them safe and healthy :o)",

My specialist seems so intelligent, yet he scared me to the point of considering a termination, which up until now, wasn't an option. While my doctor made me feel safe and secure, the specialist made me feel the opposite, but he also was telling me everything based on medical facts, and I have to weigh out the options.Plus the fact that my specailist just had a baby delivered at 24 weeks that didn't make it certainly doesn't help matters. I just wish I didn't know about it!!Also, I am a single mom raising my adopted daughter. She never sees her father, and she and I are extremely close. I am all that she has in this world. My son is 16, and from a different father, so if anything were to happen to me, she loses me, her home, her brother, everything. She would have to go live with a father who is 60 years old and never there, and a 28 year old stepmom that doesn't like her. Also, she doesn't know I am pregnant, and she will be SO excited when I tell her! What if the baby doesn't make it? She just wouldn't understand. This is all so frustrating!",

I will be praying for you that everything gets better.\u00a0\u00a0My 6 yr old prayed tonight that God doesn't let the baby in my tummy die. Which was really hard on me!\u00a0\u00a0We have talked with her about it, in 6 yr old terms the best we could.\u00a0\u00a0She knows that all our friends and family (church family too!) are praying for our health and thats about all we can do is trust in God.\u00a0\u00a0 We have lost many people close to us in the last 3 yrs, young and old and we have always tried to help her understand that God calls us home in His time not ours. It has allowed an open door to talk with her about knowing the Lord in a special and personal way and someday we will all meet again!!\u00a0\u00a0 Some think we are crazy letting her know so much about death, whether it be about my mom or our baby but she watched me grieve over the loss of my mom and I wanted her to understand the best she could that death was not scary but very sad for those of us left here.\u00a0\u00a0If I did not have my FAITH I would be flippin crazy about life right now!!! God will get us each through this and has brought us all together for strength to help us get through it.\u00a0\u00a0If it was not for this site I would not have heard anything positve!!

I have had a difficult 2 months with cramping and spotting, and I was getting so emotionally attached so early, Part of me is relieved that I didn't have to make this decision.This has been the biggest emotional rollercoaster I have ever been on, and I feel a connection with every one on this forum. I still want to check in and see how everyone is doing! I hope that's okay!Summer, your girls are beautiful!!!",

I have been reading up on ablation, and have came across nothing but \"you should'nt get pregnant after an alation, because it's high risk for the mother and baby\". I do not know how far along I am, but I believe about 4 mths already. I go to the dr. on Monday, but I was wondering has anyone heard of someone having an ablation and then getting pregnant and everything turned out great. Thank you for your time.Deanna ***@****",
