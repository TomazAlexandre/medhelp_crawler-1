He is still in the NICU, but gets to come home as soon as he is able to regularly feed by bottle.\u00a0\u00a0He started out 2 lbs, 5 oz., and is now 4 lbs. 13 oz.\u00a0\u00a0So far, he shows no signs of long-term problems, but of course, we will have to see since he is only 9 weeks old, (would be 36 weeks gestationally). I do have a cousin born 12 years ago at 27 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Today, she is very smart and sassy, but has had to wear glasses since she was a baby, and has cerebral palsy in her lower legs and feet.\u00a0\u00a0She has had some surgeries to straighten her muscles, and can actually walk quite well.\u00a0\u00a0I have also heard multiple stories (being the parent of two preemies) of success stories with babies earlier than mine.\u00a0\u00a0There is a very, very good chance that a 28-weeker can be absolutely \"normal\" in the long run.",

            "answer": "my son, (whom we adopted) was born at 23 6/7 days. One day short of 24 weeks. He had so many problems. He weighed 1.1 lbs and was 11.5 inches long. My husband and I did not know him around his birth so we can only imagine how tiny he was. He had and intraventricular hemorrage, reflux, retinopathy of prematurity, and atrial septal defect in his heart, he was on a respirator for around 2 months and when he was born he came into the world limp and they had a hard time intubating him. So, now his is almost 20 months old, running around like a nut and is doing amazingly well considering all the problems he had when he was born. All of the above issues resolved prior to him comming home from the hospital 4 months after his birth. He does receive early intervention services and has physical therapy and developmental therapy. So, my point is, it all depends on the child. You could have a full term baby born with multiple medical problems but on the other hand you could have a baby born before 24 weeks and be doing spectacular. premies are truely miracle no matter how early they are. I supposed babies that are early just can't wait to come into the world.",
