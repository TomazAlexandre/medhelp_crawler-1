            "answer": "Well, the one thing I have learned from being on this site for several years is.... Nothing is normal or abnormal during an IVF.A lot of women on here have bled during their 2ww and ended up with a BFP, and a little bundle of joy. or 2, at the end to hold. And of course, a lot of women had no bleeding at all.A lot of women had a ton of symptoms during their 2ww and some had absoultely nothing... both ending in a BFP. (big fat pregnant or positive)Also, a lot of women have had period like crampin during their 2ww and some have none...both have ended up with BFP'sI personally had NO symptoms until I was about 10 wks.\u00a0\u00a0I also bled lightly during my 2ww, and I bled heavily at about 5wks pregnant.Did you have a 3 day transfer or a 5 day transfer?Either way, you did test early.\u00a0\u00a0When is your beta? (blood test)I would think a good sign is that it has pretty much stopped.Sending tons of positive thoughts your way!!!!!!!!",

It's like why can't we at least have hope until the blood test? Why do our hopes have to be shattered so early on :(Sorry for being depressing lol, I'm on my 3rd IVF (2nd fresh cycle) and what DH and I have decided will probably be our last, just for the physical and emotional stress/risks it has on me and I started spotting 2 days ago and my blood test is only Thursday! I too was hopeful for implantation spotting, but it's that horrible feeling that each time you go, there is more and it is redder :(I'm sorry I'm not helping anyone with their questions...just need to let off some steam. thanks for listening :)",

I had two 5 day blasts transferred on Friday (feb 22), and yesterday, I started bleeding. It started out a rusty colour, then was brown mid morning. I wasn't super concerned because during my last fet I spotted around the same time and it stopped by the end of the day and resulted in a BFP (miscarried at 9 weeks however). But this time the bleeding got heavier and darker, then redder. It's never been as heavy as a period. I didn't have any bleeding at night or much in my panty liner, but every time I go to the washroom, it dripps into the toilet and its there when I wipe. I was also really crampy last night, like pulling on my uterus, and a little today. And I can feel my heart pounding when I stand up to go to the washroom...which was often yesterday.I am taking Crinone and estrace. I never took Crinone before I used the other suppositories for progesterone, and now I am worried that my body didnt agree with the Crinone? Did this happen to anyone else, and did it still result in a BFP?",

As positive as I have tried to remain, I couldn't help but break down yesterday morning. The bleeding stopped and it seemed as if my symptoms weren't as strong anymore. I did cheat. Started to take HPT's after day 5. They have all been negative so far. My reasoning to continue is so I can prepare myself if that is the final outcome. At this point I can't even stop myself from doing them if I tried. Really wish I listened to to my husband and waited till the bloodtest. My first blood test is this Friday. Even after all the pain from progesterone injections, symptoms, and emotions I'm hoping my lucky embie is inside of me handling business. I want to feel like it was all worth something. This is my first Ivf cycle, and I commend all of you ladies that have gone through this multiple times. I am barely making it, but you owe it to yourself to do this. It's so much and life changing.

Now I'm hoping my 2 little embryos are still in there. Our other embryos didn't make it. If this doesn't work, we'll have to apply for another loan and do it all over again.

    "question": "Hi, I'm new to this site and I'm on my first ivf cycle. I had my embryo transfer on 17/10/12 and i've been taking theprogesterone. I'm on my 9th day now and wed evening i had spotting like brownish pink blood. then yesterday(thusrday) morning still same then it turned to a heavy period. I spoke to my doctor and he said it should be a good sign that my period came it means that the embryo is starting implanting however he said my period came earlyand its not due in 5 days. So he's not sure if it really works or not but to wait on my blood test this.coming monday.I'm still bleeding a little bit right now but it's not heavy anymore. I'm now worried that it didn'T work coz\u00a0\u00a0actually had heavy period. Also i tried home preg test and it came up as neg i know its too early but I just hate this feeling of wondering if its all good or not.is there anyone had similar experience and still got pregnant despite having heavy period just before their blood test? also i have no symptoms of pregnancy right now except for cramps probably period pain only. Hoping someone cannhelp or give anlittle bit of advice.",
