            "answer": "To be completely honest, there isn't anything like your first cesarean delivery. Afterwards it's not so bad, you will need to recover and heal as you did your first but it's a lot easier the 2nd+ time around!! As you know it's major abdominal surgery, therefore it's going to be painful. I am expecting my 7th child, my first 6 children were all born via cesarean delivery. It's easier with each delivery, especially since you know what to expect. I am scheduled for my 7th cesarean delivery the 16th of October. Personally, the spinal tap is the one thing I hate in general about the whole procedure. In my opinion, it's quite horrible!! The operation itself is a bit nerve wrecking but not that bad. The recovery process is kinda tough the first week but a breeze for me afterwards.",

            "answer": "My first one was hard but my second was so much easier in my opinion I guess bc I knew what to expect and knew what I needed to do. I was up the same night using th bathroom and trying to walk around. Stay on top of the pain meds that is an important part of your recovery as long as you have taken them you are more able to move around easier and remember the doc wouldn't give you anything that would harm the baby (if u plan to breastfeed) just try to get up and moving asap. I am currently prepregnant with my third and due for my third csection in Jan. My doc wanted to try a vbac but with me having preeclampsia with my previous 2 he thinks I may get it again so we r leaning more toward thw csection right now.",

            "answer": "Yeah, main medication is helpful! I actually use the lowest dosage as possible, no narcotics! But that's a personal decision, I have a high tolerance for pain and I also exclusively breastfeed, so therefore I really want to be \"all there\", I hate how damn Looney they make me feel, I use Motrin. But since you have a lower tolerance for pain it's definitely a smart idea to take your pain medication on clock, rotating both Motrin/ibuprofen and what ever else your doctor may prescribe you (each OB has a personal preference on narcotics). I can give you some great tips etc to help you heal and recover like a pro lol ;)",
