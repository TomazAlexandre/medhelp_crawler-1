            "answer": "You may want to watch the amount of sodium your taking in. Salt makes you gain water big time. Try to keep it under 3000mg a day. That may be a reason why you feel so bloated. It will only get worse the farther along you are. I am 26 weeks today and I have gained 24 pounds since the beginning. and my feet, calves and fingers are tight. I'm a pretty thin person otherwise. The morning time I notice I'm more bloated than any other time. I don't know if 6lbs in 14 days is considered alot. I gained 11 lbs in one month so it's pretty much the same as your situation. my doctor is not concerned. If it's something your really worried about and if it's pretty painful you should check with your doctor to see what you can do. Good luck!",

I didnt even need to excersize. I just changed the way I ate and ate 6 meals a day instead of 3 because it stablized your blood sugar and instead of \"crashing\" you were at a constant level and so your metablisim sped up. I didnt stop eating what I wanted (like chocolate) but I understood what I was taking into my body and ate smaller portions.
