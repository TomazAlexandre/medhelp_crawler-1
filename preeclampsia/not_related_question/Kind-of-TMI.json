            "answer": "The main thing they are looking for in your urine every visit is protein, luekocytes, blood, etc. Mostly to make sure you dont have any infections like a UTI or signs of preeclampsia etc. A fishy odor could be many things, and sometimes nothing. Could be a yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis, etc but your doctor will need to swab you to test for those things. Id just let ur doc know that u notice a different smell to ur discharge and would like to be checked.",
