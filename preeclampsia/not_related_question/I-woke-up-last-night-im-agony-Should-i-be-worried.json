    "question": "Hi everyone I'm 23 weeks pregnant due 5th April. I woke up last night with terrible stomach cramps to the point I couldn't walk. I felt like I was going to be sick because of the pain. I have an 8 yr old already so know what contractions feel like and this was very similar. So maybe Braxton hicks but didn't know you could get them this early and didn't expect them to hurt quite this much. I ended up curled up on my bedroom floor where I tried to get up to walk the pain off. Has anyone else had this?",
