            "answer": "i'm glad you asked this. i was thinking of asking a similar question, although i am concerned about the opposite.i had my c-sec 13 days ago. when i left the hospital i had lost about 12 pounds. since then (8 days later) my total weight loss has been 24 pounds (12 pounds in 8 days). in fact, i am getting concerned that i am losing weight too quickly, especially i have been having some stomach problems and really don't have much of an appetite. A lot of it was fluid (i had retained a LOT due to high blood pressure and preeclampsia,), but the swelling went down a while ago and i continue to lose at least a pound/day.\u00a0\u00a0i am pumping, and i know that increases weight loss, but i want to make sure that i'm not losing too quickly to provide my baby with the neccesary nutrients.to answer your question, i am 8 pounds from my pre-pregnancy weight. i had put on about 32lbs. but, keep in mind that i delivered a month early, so i missed out on a long period of weight gain.",

            "answer": "It depends on whether or not you are breastfeeding, and how active you are. Kris123, it sounds like you are doing everything right. I know all the research I have read on weight loss says if you loose more than 2 lbs per week, it's more likely to come back to you. 1/2 to 2 lbs is the safe range for weight loss. This info doesn't take into consideration childbirth, but I can't imagiine it would be more different. Hope this helps!",
