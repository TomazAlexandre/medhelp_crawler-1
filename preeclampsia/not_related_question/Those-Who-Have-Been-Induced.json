            "answer": "I have to disagree- a doctor should do what is medically necessary, not respect your wishes due to be uncomfortable. If you have a medically necessary reason to be induced then obviously they'll set that up. They won't induce you \"just because\". Their priority is to make sure you and baby are safe. Inductions have a high rate of emergency c-sections.I would start off as naturally as possible. Have them strip your membranes (if you're dilated). This caused me to give birth to each of my daughters (two separate pregnancies) within 24 hours. After they strip your membranes they should let you walk and move and try to get your body to dilate on its own.And then they should break your water. I would hold off on Pitocin as long as possible. In fact I have read so many awful things about it, from L&D nurses, that I want to avoid it completely this birth.Good luck!",

This is my second child, and my first was born on his due date. I have a Dr appointment tomorrow afternoon and was wondering if you think my Dr will decide on an induction date. I sure hope she does, because I see her every Monday, and if we wait till my following appointment, I would be 9 days over due. So do you think they will choose an induction date?",
