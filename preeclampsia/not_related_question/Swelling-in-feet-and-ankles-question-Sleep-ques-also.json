I guess your dr checks your bloodpressure so I don't think you have to worry about that.\u00a0\u00a0You may have carpal tunnel syndrome?\u00a0\u00a0I got a wrist brace and it really helped the pain and the swelling.",

            "answer": "I don't know much about the swelling, but as for the sleeping, I was like that during my first pregnancy, also. I found a body pillow to be VERY helpful. I had been in a car accident 5 years prior, and had some pinched nerve problems in my neck, which caused pain in my arms. I found a good massage therapist who worked wonders for me. Maybe that would help. And if it doesn't help, can a hour for yourself with someone massaging you really HURT? :)Re the swelling, I think there are other signs of preeclampsia, high blood pressure being one. Perhaps that is why your midwife/dr isn't concerned, but I would definitely be going back for another visit if you didn't feel content with their answer...Hope you feel better.",

            "answer": "Try to stay off your feet alot during the day. Swelling by the end fo the day is natural for most pregnant women. However, if you have edema, which is pitting of the skin, then you should probably call your Dr. Pitting is when you push on the skin of your ankle with one finger and rather than bouncing right back, it stays pitted for several seconds.Also, as mentioned, your blood pressure will be sky high with pre-eclampsia. YOur Dr is probably checking that at every visit and chances are if your BP has been normal this long, it will probalby remain normal. (THough that's NOT a gaurantee...just PROBABLY)AS for sleeping, I am having the same problem. I have tried the pillow thing (surround myself with pillows and one under belly) but it doens't help. But like you, laying on one side for too long numbs that side. Actually, it also happens when I am sitting on hard chair, one side of my body becomes numb. ANd when I say numb, I mean it begins to fall asleep. That annoying tingling feeling. I wish I could help you in how to fix it, but at least you know you're not alone! :)",

It IS SO annoying because it's not like it isn't hard enough to sleep as it is, then you have to turn every 30 min's and with a belly like a mountain, it takes no small amount of effort to swing the belly from one side to the other. In fact, sometimes I am so tired and my belly is so \"cumbersome\" (as my DH puts it) that I stop mid turn and have to lay there and catch my breath!",

    "question": "I am confused. My Midwife told me to watch for signs of preeclamsia one of them being swelling. I know that swelling in your feet is normal during pregnancy so how do I know if it is something to worry about or not. My feet and ankles swell up so bad by the end of the day and Im not even on my feet that much.I also have a question about sleeping?? I sleep on my sides and use pillows between my legs and under my belly but I still cannot stay on one side for very long, whichever side I am on my arm and leg start hurting really bad, just sharp pain all the way down. Does anyone else experience this and if so have you found a better position to sleep.Thanks,PeanutMom",
