            "answer": "actually, your mucus plug doesn't always contain blood, as you can lose it bit by bit and not even know you lost it. I ended up in labor and delivery and was dilated and they said yes I had already lost mine. All I recalled was the past couple weeks at times having large amounts of stringy clear mucousy stuff. Just tell your doctor when you see changes in stuff like that, you never know it could be part of your mucous plug. Everyone is different.",

I'm 33 weeks pregnant with my first and today when I went to go pee (tmi) I wiped and noticed a glob of clear/whitish mucus looking thing on my tissue which I'm guessing is my mucus plug. Does it sound like my mucus plug? How long after you ladies lost your mucus plug did you go into labor? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you and congrats ladies!",
