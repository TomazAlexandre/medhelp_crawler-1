    "question": "Hello, I just turned 40 in October and am 5 weeks 2 days pregnant. I conceived naturally. I live in Saudi Arabia and the Doctor prescribed baby aspirin and folic acid. I then called my gyn in Italy who told me to take the \"maternal Centrum DHA\" which is the Italian multicentum ( has no vitamin A and does have folic acid). I asked if I could take both the centrum and the aspirin and he said it was ok. During last pregnancy ( 8 months ago) my blood pressure started increasing when I was about 7 months.It wasn't dangerously high, but enough for me to have to take Aldomet 500 mg (half in the morning and half in the evening) -everything went well at delivery. Therefore, am I safe to take the baby aspirin (called Juspirin 81 mg here) or not? I had a completely healthy child without it before, I just really want to be on the safe side and know the pro's and con's from a Doctor....thanks...",
