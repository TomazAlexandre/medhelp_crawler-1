            "answer": "I dont think being hot or having a fever has any connection to high blood pressure but maybe I am wrong. Most targets and walgreens have blood pressure booths that you can use or you can buy your own battery operated cuff to monitor it at home. If your blood pressure has been fine at all your checkups I would try not to worry too much. One indicator of high blood pressure is a change in vision, like seeing spots.High blood pressure can lead to preeclampsia and it can compromise the placenta.Low blood pressure isn't as big of a concern and it is less common than high BP, the biggest concern with low blood pressure is that you could get dizzy and faint.You are likely warm because of that little furnace of a baby growing inside of you lol I feel the same way too, I am sitting in my tank top and underwear right now with the windows open and it's 50 degrees outside. I am always boiling.",

            "answer": "being hot has nothing to do with BP. I live in Hot land 24/7. Its the hormones. Now if ur face becomes flushed that can indicate high bp, other than that the only real sign is head aches. If you are concerned about BP, go somewhere like a drug store that keeps a BP monitor where u can test it. Or at your next doctors apt they should check it. High BP for a few days or wks won't affect the baby.",

            "answer": "I agree with dkl. It most likely is the weight you have gained and the hormones. At this stage we are all lugging around a baby anywhere from 2-5 lbs some of us like dkl are blessed with big babies so our hearts and breathing are going to get interuppted. My blood pressure is high at some apps and low at others if the dr is concerned he rechecks it before I leave. I would not worry just mention any concerns you may have at your next app so you feel better!AP",
