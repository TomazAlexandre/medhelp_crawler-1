I was given picotin after my labour started so my cobtraxtions wouldnt slow down. Its the same thing they give u to induce labour. I started my labour in 2nd stage as i was already 4cm ddialated b4 labour started. Once they gave me the picotin it made my cobtractions 10x srronger and faater. I wasnt even getting a break inbetween they were just one after another but it made my labour really quick. Wasnt a pleasant experience but i would do it again this pregnancy if it meant quick labour.",
