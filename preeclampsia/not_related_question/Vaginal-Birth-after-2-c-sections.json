I had the same thing, breech and then tried v-bac only to end up with a second c-section anyway because they were afraid the uterus was tearing. It turns out the baby had troubles and it wasn't my uterus. I was told by my doc that it is dangerous to do labor after to c-sections. To much of a risk of rupture.",

Your uterus can rupture, and if it does they need to perform a hysterectomy, in addition to other life saving measures (you would be bleeding out if you ruptured). I am a maternity nurse and when we hear about a rupture after a VBAC attempt we all pray for the family. I think the previous post was correct, after two C-sections I don't think a doctor would do a VBAC. But look at the bright side...you will be so much safer having another section, and your other little ones need you around :). Good luck with whatever you decided! :)",

My first son I delivery was vaginal, My next son was breech and was a c-section, My 3rd son was fine but the doctor at the time would not let me do a vbac he said he did not preform them. Well I would like another child and am struggling because I would like a natural birth. I am hoping I can get others experiences before I decide what I would do. I am lost and I would really like a natural birth. I did hear it is very dangerous. I just want all the information I can get.",
