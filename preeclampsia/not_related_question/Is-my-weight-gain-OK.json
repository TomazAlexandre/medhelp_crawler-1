            "answer": "if your ob is ok with it and you arent having problems with swelling or high bl pressure, you should tell them to mind their own business. of course your mom only gained 20 pounds, all of ours did. they were told to diet and to keep their weight gain low. i even read at one time in history they were prescribed diet pills. you are eating well, exercising, and what more can you do?? your body will do what it wants,, we are all different. i dont know you or can see you, but i think you are doing one heck of a job!! there have been quite a few posts the past week regarding weight gain. i think its sad that most of us are completly burdened with the thoughts of how much we gain. i am overweight to begin with. so i know i need to be careful. but im also tired of every day stressing over what i should eat or shouldnt eat. how often i eat blah blah blah. im only 8 weeks, i have a LONG road ahead of me. like i said its something you should discuss with your ob, not mom or dad or the chiropractor.",

            "answer": "I think you are doing just fine...what does your OB/GYN say?It sounds like you are eating healthy and even exercising...and the recommended weight gain is 25-35 lbs -- 35 lbs if you were of normal weight (which you were) when you got pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0This is a guideline and as long as you are not experiencing any medical problems (diabetes, preeclampsia, else) and YOUR doctor (not your chiropractor) isn't concerned, I would politely tell all these people to mind their own business.\u00a0\u00a0You can tell them that while you appreciate their concern, a lot has changed since your MIL had a baby and that YOUR doctor has assured you that your weight gain is fine.If that doesn't work, I'd just ask them when they got their medical degree -- oh, don't have one, then I guess I really will listen to my doc.Lastly, with my first preg. I had trouble gaining weight initially -- only about 10 lbs in the first 20 weeks due to bad morning sickness.\u00a0\u00a0But, but pregnancy end I had gained 42 lbs (went through the holidays, please...).\u00a0\u00a0I had a very healthy and happy baby at almost 8 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I dropped back to my \"normal\" size within 4-5 months.\u00a0\u00a0My second I gained less -- about 30 -- and still managed to drop back down.Older now and not at the same weight, but pregger again and hoping to keep weight under control.You are doing great -- best of luck -- it is only the beginning of the two cents -- suggest laying the groundwork with \"helpful\" relatives right away so they can temper their advice -- unless you really want it all.",
