            "answer": "Girl size has Nothing to do with the ability to be able to have a baby vaginally. Take me for example I am only 5'2 and my pre-pregnancy weight was 117. My son is one month old and I am proud to say that I gave birth to him vaginally and he weighed 8 pounds 3 oz and was 20 and a half inches long.Don't get me wrong I was very worried at the begining as well as you because I wasn't sure if I would be able to push him out. I was terrified of the word \"c-section\" just the thought of there being a possibility of me having to have one made me sick to my stomache. But in the end it doesn't matter trust me. You'll be too focused on just having a healthy baby that c-section or vaginal doesn't matter.Ohh and also should I mention that I had to have an episotmy (spelling??) Done. It was to the 4th degree.. But now I am 4 weeks postpartum and I am feeling better then ever :)If you wanna talk I am here ;) send me a message",

Babies so on may 4th I go in for my 3rd c-section, but don't be scared if you did end up needing one it's not that bad. When you get further along talk to your ob about it and tell them your concerns. Good luck",
