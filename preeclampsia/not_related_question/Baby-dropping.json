            "answer": "My doctor told me the sooner they flip around the better because then you don't have to worry about them not doing it. And you still have a while to go! Who knows the baby could just be doing cartwheels:) my little guy switched to all kinds of positions before he finally stayed head down.",

    "question": "I'm 27 weeks with my 4th. I feel like she has dropped. Lots of new pressure. Belly looks lower too. Is it possible? She's always been on the low side. It also feels like she may have already switched to head down. It's been almost 7 years since I've done this so I'm curious what you ask think.",
