She used a vaginal ultrasound and she did it for a while she said this is the yolk sac and explained what it was for but when she was telling me there was NOTHING there? I was pretty confused. Then she said a few times she thought she saw a flickering of a heartbeat\u00a0\u00a0and tried to look for a while but then didn't feel good about what she said and then told me she wanted me to go back in 2 weeks so she could do another ultrasound and find the heartbeat. Im changing doctors though and im seeing a new one in a week at a new office. I just dont like her. She doesn't spend enough time with me and never answers my questions. I have a high risk pregnancy as it is. I have 2 babies who are 3 and 1. My first was born at 33 weeks because of severe preeclampsia and my next was born at 35 weeks because of mild preeclampsia and preterm labor plus I just had a miscarriage in Sept.Im REALLY trying so hard not to worry right now and just make it to my next appt I just wish I had an answer ya know?",

My HCGs are really good and doubling, and my progesterone is good, so I have a little hope. Doesnt it make you crazy waiting!!! I cant believe I have to wait 2 more weeks. They cant see a heartbeat until after 6 weeks, and a fetal pole at 5.5, I think. The yolk sac being there is a very good sign- I dont think the yolk sac is ever there in a blighted ovum.

    "question": "Well I just went to the Doctor on Tuesday. I was 5 weeks and 4 days by my LMP (Oct-28) I know for sure that I ovulated on day 16 of my cycle since I was charting and I got a positive htp at 8 dpo anyway... When they did my ultrasound all we could see is an empty sac. She \"said\" she saw the yolk sac but I really dont think she did since I didn't see ANYTHING and im really could with ultrasound and I was sitting there watching the whole thing. She also did it for a while. Im guessing she was a little worried since she set me up for another ultrasound in 2 weeks. Im not going back to her again though because I always feel confused when I leave there and still have questions. Im going to a new doctor on Dec-14 which will make me 6+ weeks and i'll get a new ultrasound. Im very worried though that there was only a gas sac found. Shouldn't there have at least been a nice yolk sac found? Thank you!",
