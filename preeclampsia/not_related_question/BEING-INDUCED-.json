    "question": "I'm due march 13th but I will be induced around week 37 which is around February 20th . I was wondering have anyone been induced before ? If so what was the outcome? I'm 31weeks and 2days and my baby is 3lbs 7oz I was wondering do anyone think I will be able to bring my daughter home ? I'm a Ftm and I'm nervous. Also I am being induced because of bowel acids and they usually don't let pregnant women go the full 40 weeks with this condition",
