            "answer": "How far along are you? Back pain is very common during the last trimester, so if they're checking you out and sending you home it's because you're not dilating with your contractions, and back pain, meaning it's not real labor. BH can be very uncomfortable. Unless you're at least 40 weeks, some will let you go 41 before they talk about induction, or c-section. Most doctors won't let you just do an elective c-section, some insurances don't cover it if it's elective. I would really, really try natural first. I had a c-section and I had a much better experience than most do, but it's a very major abdominal surgery, and you have to keep that in mind with recovery (it's going to hurt more than back labor) and with future pregnancies. Good luck!!",

With your first, again unless your BP gets dangerously high, they won't let you deliver til at least 39 weeks. How high was your BP the last time? It may be elevated but not enough to signify preeclampsia, or you may have just elevated BP and no other signs of preeclampsia, in that case they won't deliver you just yet. The last trimester really *****, try to take it easy, take tylenol, baths, heating pads and relax as much as you can. It's almost over!",

            "answer": "That is pretty high for your BP, but unless your showing other signs of preeclampsia they can't induce or give you the option of a c-section yet (unless you go into labor on your own). Heart palpitations are normal during pregnancy, I get them ALL the time, I have had them with both pregnancies and have had healthy pregnancies each time. That H/B isn't safe, though. Most doctors will agree anything over 180-190 isn't safe.. is there another doctor you could see or switch to? Have you talked to your doctor about your concern about how high that was? I'm 4'11 and my last baby was almost 9lbs, so I can relate to nothing working with pain, unfortunately that's most of us our last trimester. Have you tried anything to induce yourself naturally? Primrose oil? Walking? Sex? Bouncing on a ball? That might help. If you go into labor now they won't stop it.",

I know you can take it vaginally or orally and it's supposed to progress your cervix and help you go into labor. For some women it happens very quickly, for some it takes a little longer. I'd look it up online, primrose oil to induce labor, you can buy it right at a pharmacy and it's worth a shot!",

The thing is pain and discomfort during or at the end of pregnancy is normal - you're carrying a large child, fluid and everything else. It won't be a cake walk. Just make sure to take it easy, you don't have much longer. A c-section won't help your pain, it'll just add to it and make things harder.",
