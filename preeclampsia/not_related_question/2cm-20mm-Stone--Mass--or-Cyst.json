            "answer": "Hi and Welcome. You are certainly not dumb. We all learn by asking questions.You certainly had a difficult pregnancy. Preeclampsia (the development of proteinuria and hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation) unfortunately is not uncommon. The issues that coincide with it can range from near nothing to serious life changing problems. I'm sorry you are still struggling with it's aftermathOur ureters measure from 2mm-5mm. As you know you'll not \"pass\" that large stone. The largest one measured that I passed (and there have been many) was a 7mm - very painful. They said I wouldn't pass it but I did.An IVP (Intravenous Pyelogram) is a much more detailed picture of the entire Urinary Track System compared to a CT scan. As you know an IVP requires a contrast material (dye), injected into a vein. This dye details structure, size, shape and so forth with more specific detail than a CT. However The Computed Tomography (CT) scan will be used in conjunction with the IVP to provide a better, more accurate DX (Diagnosis).\u00a0\u00a0I've had both. A CT missed an important detail - the IVP caught it.I'm not able to tell you for certain if the size of this stone will have a permanent impact on your kidney. I doubt it. Any abnormalities should resolve and return to normal.I know this \"waiting\" for the final results of tests if often a maddening, stress filled time. My heart goes out to you. Our minds can run wild - and most often the results are far better than what our imaginations conjured up. That's what I hope for you.I also hope in time this will all be a distant, unpleasant memory. Please keep in touch and let us know how you are doing. You'll be in my thoughts and I'll watch for your updates.Best of Luck,~Tuck",

    "question": "Ok, so a year and 9 months ago I was pregnant and found it was throwing protein in my urine. Had my baby a month early due to pre-e. I was being seen in the pregnancy by urologist for the protein and blood. Had an u/s then and they saw the right kidney was enlarged and both kidneys had something in them, possibly stones. Being pregnant he said we will just watch and address after baby. Well, my labor was intense cause I developed pre-e and my liver enzymes went up and my plates were low. I was told I needed to see a renal specialist after that to which I did and he told me he couldn't do anything until 6months to a year post because the pre-e will hold on. So here I am a year later from giving birth, and repeat us they said nothing in left kidney, and right is still slightly enlarged and I have a 2cm (20mm) Stone\u00a0\u00a0(renal specialist said, urologist refuses to say that until the results from my Ivp xray are back). My question. Is those who have experienced this, did you have lasting effects to the kidney due to this size. Mine is stuck/embedded between the ureter and the kidney. I'm still throwing blood protein, and bp is normally 140-130s/90s. What will this ivp show really? What is the difference in an ivp xray and ct scan? I probably sound dumb. I have a history of 4 yes ago passing two stones. So feel that this likely is a large stone. Family history of kidney cancer and disease. Ok. I think I have covered it all. And I'm 25yr old. I know a lot of this is the doctor will have to answer but any one who has been through all this who can offer advice, insight, suggestions, ect would be greatly appreciated.",
