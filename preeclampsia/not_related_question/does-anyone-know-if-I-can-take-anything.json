            "answer": "Please read this, and urge your doctor to address your situation immediately. This was the experience of my life-long friend who delivered her baby last Friday night, and almost lost her life:She gained ten pounds in the week leading up to last Monday and another ten between Monday and Wednesday of last week - fluid buildup.\u00a0\u00a0Her hands and fingers were stiff and swollen and she said she felt ill and felt like something had changed.\u00a0\u00a0Her doctor told her not to be concerned.\u00a0\u00a0As it turns out, the stiff, swollen hands are often one of the early symptoms of a pregnancy complication.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor seemed more concerned with how dilated she was than with any other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Her vision went blurry on Friday.\u00a0\u00a0She had not been able to urinate for several days.pre\u00b7eclamp\u00b7siaPronunciation: pr-i-klam(p)-s-Function: noun: a serious condition developing in late pregnancy that is characterized by a sudden rise in blood pressure, excessive weight gain, generalized edema, proteinuria, severe headache, and visual disturbances and that may result in eclampsia if untreatedBy Friday, she was past preeclampsia and was in eclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0Her system was in bad shape.\u00a0\u00a0She was in danger of seizure, her hemoglobin was seriously low, and her platelet count was something like one-tenth of low-end normal - low platelets mean no clotting ability.\u00a0\u00a0The last thing the doctor told her before the surgery was that she would probably bleed out on the table.\u00a0\u00a0Her husband came out of the OR and told her parents that he has a son but said that he doesn't know if he has a wife.\u00a0\u00a0Her uncle, an RN-anesthetist, said that with the platelet count as low as it was, she should not have been able to clot - he's saying it was a miracle.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that they were very close to losing both her and the baby.The doctor's original plan was to wait until Monday.\u00a0\u00a0They now know that she probably would have gone into cardiac arrest before Monday.She is angry.\u00a0\u00a0Anger is good.\u00a0\u00a0She and the whole family know that the joy of the event was taken from them by the doctor's mistake.\u00a0\u00a0Her parents are not the happy grandparents they would like to be.\u00a0\u00a0They have been shaken.I don't want to scare you, but this can be super-serious. And for all the other moms-to-be out there, make sure you have a partner or friend who is willing to strangle any doctor or nurse who doesn't take your concerns seriously. Many times pregnant women are put off by the \"professionals\" because they assume the woman is just worrying needlessly. My friend's doctor ignored her concerns, and my friend allowed herself to believe the doctor was right and her instincts were wrong. By God's good grace, she is still alive.",

            "answer": "I am familiar with it, I was induced with my 3 prior children due to preeclampsia, I had it a lot worse with them. The doctor has been monitoring my bp's, I check them daily and log them. He has started the non stress tests. I called my doctor he said to reduce my salt, which I barely use. I dont call the doctor for anything, I am in such pain, I cannot seem to convince him that I don't feel right. He does want me to come in for a bp check and to test my urine with the nurse",

            "answer": "tif, i am dealing with preeclampsia and the hands are one of my many symptoms. my doctor has me spending as much time as possible lying on my left side preferably, but he has said my right is almost just as good. never flat on my back. if i am sitting after 15 minutes i am to get up and walk down the hall and back one time. i also am to drink 3 quarts of water a day. apparently that will help flush the toxins out and reduce the swelling. the only thing i get for pains is tylenol.avoiding the heat, lying down and drinking a lot of water seems to help reduce my edema. less edema means less pain for me.and as for the salt thing, i only get what salt comes in food naturally and it has not impacted me. i think the salt theory is related to high salt intake being associated with high blood pressure. just a guess, but salt doesn't seem to phase me.\u00a0\u00a0if he doesn't take you serious, i would either go to the emergency room or find a different doctor( even though i know how hard that is so late in the game...)i hope you feel better.",

I have had swelling in my feet and ankles but not the hands and it just started. I can barely drive to work as I cannot close them around the wheel.
