She said when a women turns 30 something, many experience their biological clock's ticking. At that time, I thought is she crazy my clock is all ticked out. I'm glad to say, for some reason I followed her adivce. She was right. With a new DH, and feeling the need to procreate we have been trying for 2 1/2 years. The first year and half, I had 5 m/c, 2 being ectopic. Spent the last year trying. Went through IVF on 08/16, finally got a BFP 10dp3dt, and just had a D&C today. The baby stopped growing at 6wks. Just like all the rest of my angels. This has been very difficult for us. At this point, I am feeling better, but I have to be honest I am a little upset with GOD right now. Can I do that? Well, we are planning on moving forward. However I have a consult with my RE, and a new one. I think maybe we need a change. Good luck to all you ladies here.",

I put off testing, thinking that if it worked once it will happen again, just be patient, but my time is ticking....very loudly for the last 2 years! I had fully accepted that is was not my fate to have another child, 3 months ago but recently I decided to not give up without knowing for sure, so I finally made the step of seeing my doctor. I will be going for my first blood tests tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0I am 90% sure I am the one with the problem, and have had a deep sinking feeling for 10 years that something wasn't right, but was given new hope when I conceived my daughter. Now that hope has faded into an abyss of confusion, regret and self doubt. Trying to stay positive month after month is difficult, and gets harder as each year passes. Time waits for no one. Hope I didn't bum anyone out.....just dealing with a flood of mixed feelings right now.",

I get that alot , so looking for support, for other who are going through this same situation.If you would like to share your story, PLEASE post !!! We get to start trying in about 6 weeks, just being 5 days outside surgery I can wait that time...LOL This is very exciting\u00a0\u00a0yet stressful as the possibility of not becoming pregnant, and the xtra challenges older mommy to be's face.\u00a0\u00a0I wish everyone who is trying the best of LUCK!!! =)Kelly~",
