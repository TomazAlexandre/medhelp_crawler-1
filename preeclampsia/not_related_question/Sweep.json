            "answer": "When they do it right stripping your membranes consists of pressing the amniotic sac away from the inside of the cervix usually in a circular or sweeping motion. I've had it done twice tho I don't think the 2nd doctor did it right and I think you can get it wrong. The first doctor swept on a tues afternoon and I had my baby by wed morning. The nurse called it a roto-rooter exam...it just felt like a rough exam to me. It helps to stimulate your body to produce labor inducing hormones and encourages your water sac to be able to break tho it doesn't always. You can just start contractions after. And it doesn't always work..but it always helps me to have that end date in mind without the threat of induction",

            "answer": "It depends on your measurement. I'm 35 weeks measuring 38. My doc said he will do one in two weeks, since I'm measuring bigger and tend to have big babies, lol. And they will not induce me since I've had a previous c-section, followed by a vbac, considered high risk. :-)",

My old clinic could do them anytime after 37 weeks. Depends on you and the protocol at the places you're seen unless there is something that would need u to deliver early like preeclampsia or something.",
