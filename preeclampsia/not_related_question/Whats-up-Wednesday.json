I want something closer to home...even if it pays a little less then this. Well I guess I wouldn't want to be paid less...but hey you know what I mean! And yesterday my mom and I were so mad! There's a burger place/restuarant that was celebrating its 24th anniversary with selling their signature burgers for a dollar! Well the girl that's in the same position as me decided she wanted to go there for lunch, even though she wasn't planning on getting that burger! So we told her that it was going to be a madhouse there and that it would take forever! Well she wanted to go anyway! We are customer service, we answer the phone when it rings and it rings all day...its the two of us and the others in the office only answer when they have to. We have 30 min lunches too because of the hours we work/opperate. So she finally leaves at 11:30. I am starving too so I tell them not to take forever because I am hungry!(jokingly of course) Time passes...45 minutes...an hour...We are so busy while she's gone I am constantly on the phone. It was another girl's birthday so she took a longer minute lunch but left a little after 11:30. So that girl gets back at almost 12:30..no biggy its her bday.\u00a0\u00a0So my stomach is starting to hurt because I am so hungry...More time goes by..then one of the guys she went with comes back and tells us they're still waiting for their food! Its like a fast food place...like kfc kind of. I am getting kind of annoyed at this point. Since the other girl came back either my mom or I can go get food but we normally take lunch together, but this time one of us would have to eat at our desk to help with the phones which we don't feel like doing. They finally get back at 1:15! Then the girl has the nerve to ask me why my mom didnt go get me food!? I told her its because we didn't want to eat here. \"Well don't go to Culvers!\" I just wanted to slap her. She didn't even apologize for taking almost 2 hours to get her lunch...I am getting so sick of the people I work with...its like high school, drama and selfishness...I am TIRED OF IT! lol...I just want a new job...but I really hate the whole hiring process and interviews...oy..lol",

I have my lab practical on monday night...ahhh...will it ever end?Sorry for being long winded....just frustrated.",
