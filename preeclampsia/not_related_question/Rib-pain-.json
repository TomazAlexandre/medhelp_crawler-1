    "question": "During the day I think perhaps its my bra causing this discomfort, my upper rib cage, jyst under my breasts, feeling squeezed. But just laying down to sleep at night or napping I get a pain in my rib cage area on whatever side I'm laying on. It hurts and feels like a side ache when you're out of shape trying to run. Sometimes I get shortness of breath and most of it the pain and discomfort is when laying down. What do y'all think???",
