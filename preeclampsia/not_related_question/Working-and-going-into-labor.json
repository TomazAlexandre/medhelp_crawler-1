    "question": "I am 32 weeks and I haven't been to work in three days. But the past three days I've been in pain. I can barely walk since my feet and ankles swell and get swollen. I have had light contractions that go away within an hour. I called my nurse and she said its all normal. I have high blood pressure and I am totally scared going back to work (where I stand on my feet for 5 or 6 hours straight).Am I just stressing?",
