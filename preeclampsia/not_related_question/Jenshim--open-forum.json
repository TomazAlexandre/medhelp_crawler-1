            "answer": "Hi! Thanks for asking. My head hurt so bad, so I called and asked a nurse if I should be concerned. She said to just come in and get my BP checked. I did and it was 147/99!! I have NO idea why it was that high. I was in L&D for about 3 hrs and it gradually went down to about 120/80. My headache didn't go away though. Swelling was minimal and urine was negative for protein. While I was there though, I was having LOTS of contractions. So much that they thought it was necessary to check me. I am only a fingertip dilated and a little effaced. They sent me home with Tylenol #3 (codeine). I took that and then went to bed. Headache seems to be gone today. I don't get why I had such high BP and then it went down, but I guess I should just be glad that so far I don't have preeclampsia.How is everyone else today?",

They told me pain can bring up your blood pressure, so that could have been it. Once I got there the room was dark and I relaxed in the bed. It might have been just enough to bring it down. I have a digital BP monitor now though, thanks to a good friend of mine who is a nurse. I will be using that whenever I think it's high.",
