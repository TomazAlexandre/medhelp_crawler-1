            "answer": "I don't really have advice on how to make the baby come on its own as it is up to your own body, but I will say that should it get to that point, just remember that the doctor is choosing inducement for both of your safety. After a certain point the baby loses what it needs to survive inside of you. More likely the doctor is trying to prevent that.",

Not to mention the doctors were taking full advantage of the fact I was in pain and kept forcing the epidural on me...Just not a fun experience I want this birth to be more enjoyable.",

    "question": "I'm now 40w2d and if my baby girl doesn't come by Sunday I'll be induced Monday morning...I really want to avoid being induced because I was planning on having a natural water birth. I have tried walking, primrose oil and raspberry leaf tea but it obviously isn't working.\u00a0\u00a0I am 3cm but hardly any contractions but lost my plug last week. Anyone have any tips? My first DD went 3 days over due so maybe this one will be the same and I wont have to be induced *fingers crossed*",
