            "answer": "I feel the same. I'm worried my water will break and I won't recognize it as anything more than urine leakage. With a gbs positive result early in pregnancy, I'll need antibiotics to protect my baby once the water breaks. If I don't know, how can I protect her?!?Another thing I'm scared of is preeclampsia. I have a history of high blood pressure. My midwives and doctors know it, but they don't seem as concerned as me about it. At first they just said the blood pressure and swelling was normal. Headaches are common too. So long as protein was in the urine, baby was fine. I was still worried. Finally, one visit they did measure protein and directed me to the er only for it to be a false alarm. Very stressful and scary, but I'm glad it turned out to be nothing. Still, does it have to go so far as a scare for them to take my fears seriously?In the beginning, (mind you I only found out I was pregnant at 13 wks) I was so scared of the effects the medicines I was taking could have on my baby, the xray i got when I fell and broke my ankle, the poor diet I maintain despite my trying to improve it, etc... I know where you're coming from.Like you, I worry a lot, but I think it's natural. If we worry and find something wrong, then it's better than not worrying and not knowing until it's too late. But even so, we should try not to over-stress. It's not good for our babies blood flow or our own mental health.Right now, with only a few weeks till my original due date, I worry about how and when I'm going to get to the hospital in time if I go into labor before the scheduled cesarean date on the 4th. Who's going to cover for me at work if this new girl I'm supposed to start training tomorrow doesn't work out? How am I supposed to keep my blood pressure down while training a new employee and worrying about getting out in time to relax at home before I crash from fatigue? How will my bf get to the hospital if we only have one working vehicle right now and I'm using it to get to work each day? Should I even be driving this late in pregnancy? Etc. Etc. Etc.Now I feel we're so close to the end -baby and I- that something is bound to happen.. Believe me, I know how you feel.",

    "question": "So as soon as I found out I was pregnant (January 11th) me & my boyfriend were happy & excited without a doubt!!! However I was so scared & terrified of something going wrong such as a miscarriage or going to my appointments just to find out my baby had died. I couldn't tell you how many times I've went to the ER because I thought something was wrong but thank god nothing ever was! I found out at 8 weeks that my progesterone levels were low & that increased my chances of a miscarriage & preterm labor. I've been taking progesterone shots & pills through out my whole pregnancy & my levels have gradually went up! I'll be 37 weeks Wednesday & I honestly never thought I'd make it this far due to the circumstances! Now that I only have 2-3 weeks left I feel like it's too good to be true & something bad is going to happen. I mainly think this because I have the worst luck ever! If I didn't have bad luck I wouldn't have any luck & I'm not even kidding. Other than that there's no reason for me to feel this way. I pray to God every night that everything will be okay with my son. Did anyone else feel like this toward the end? Any advice is greatly appreciated!!!",
