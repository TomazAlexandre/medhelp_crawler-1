    "question": "Hi Ladies:I am 28 weeks pregnant with twins (almost 29) I have pain in my upper ribs,directly below my right breast. At first I thought it was my underwire bra so I switched to a jog bra about a week ago, but it still hurts quite a bit. It really hurts and when I manually hold my breast up, which is not good look ....it eases up a little.& them baby B starts kicking out of control in that spot...like he is free at last! I read some of the archives and this seems to happen to pregnant woman, but I wonder why, and I want to see if anyone else on here is going through this?Does anyone know what can make it feel better? Ice? Stretching? Lying down?",
