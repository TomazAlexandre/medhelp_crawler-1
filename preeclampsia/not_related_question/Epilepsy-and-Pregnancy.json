            "answer": "Hello,First off, it is important to note that over 90 percent of women with epilepsy have a normal pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0However, a number of obstetrical complications are reported to be more common in women with epilepsy; these include low birth weight, lower Apgar scores, preeclampsia, bleeding, placental abruption, and prematurity.Regarding medication, as with all medications taken during pregnancy one must consider the risks versus the benefits.\u00a0\u00a0The four major antiepileptic drugs: phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, and phenobarbital have been associated with an increased risk of both major and minor malformations in fetuses.\u00a0\u00a0There is limited human information on the fetal risks of the newer antiepileptic drugs such as those you note: Keppre and Lamictal.I suggest prior to beginning attempts at conceiving you and your husband should meet with your neurologist as well as a maternal fetal medicine specialist to discuss in greater detail the potential risks involved, and how best to maximize the potential for a good outcome.Best regards,Dr. Downing",

            "answer": "i have a seizure disorder and take 300mg carbamezapine twice each day. my neuro had me take an EEG first and it showed too risky for me to come off my seizure medicine so what he has me doing is taking an extra 3 folic acid pills each day (on top of my prenatal) while trying to get pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0unfortunately i've had three consecutive miscarriages but all those dr's involved say it is completley NOT related to the seizur disorder or the medication.",
