Since you are older than 35 you have a slightly higher risk for some things...but the best advise I can give is talk to your Dr about all of this. He/she will help set your mind at ease and will know more about all those questions",

Am I at more of risk on those?",

Some women have quite a few of these due to recurrent pregnancy losses and still go on to have a subsequent healthy pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Things should be fine.\u00a0\u00a0Just speak to your doctor about your concerns.\u00a0\u00a0THey should also monitor your cervix to make sure there are no problems there.\u00a0\u00a0But these can also be addressed if they are looked for early.Your risk for down syndrome and other defects are also pretty low.\u00a0\u00a0But the baby can be screened for these later in the pregnancy.",

            "answer": "Hi there,Just wanted to chime in and let you know that an abortion performed surgically with no complications rarely has any negative impact on a pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I had several miscarriages prior to having my son (at 40) and had to have a few d&c's as a result.\u00a0\u00a0There was no problem.I say rarely cause a problem because in a few cases (and this is not common), scar tissue can develop that can sometimes impact ability to carry.\u00a0\u00a0However, my understanding is this impacts implantation and typically results in a chemical pregnancy or very early miscarriage (before 6 weeks).\u00a0\u00a0So it sounds like things are great.\u00a0\u00a0And again, it is not common to have this happen.Do make sure you are honest with your Dr. when giving your history.\u00a0\u00a0Never be ashamed of earlier decisions.\u00a0\u00a0It is legal and you did what you felt was right at the time.\u00a0\u00a0It is important for your Dr. to know your history, and not their place to be judgemental.Congrats on your pregnancy, and I wish you a healthy and happy 9 months!!",

My doctor told me know pregnancy is the same. Oh I think I was about to develop preeclampsia with number 5, but I had to deliver him earlier(2 months early). But I do have high blood pressure currently. I think you we are already consider high risk because of our age (over 35)Enjoy your pregnancy!!!!!!",

    "question": "Hello all - I'm fairly new to the boards.\u00a0\u00a0Just had my first ultrasound on Friday and baby is good! Heart beat of 138 beats per minute.\u00a0\u00a0This was a nice surprise after doc thought I had a possible ectopic or miscarriage coming up because a week prior nothing was seen on the ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0So I feel blessed!I have some concerns though and have not yet talked to my doctor about them.\u00a0\u00a0I'm truly hoping that you will have some good advice for me and I'm hoping that I'm not judged at all for what I'm about to say.I'm 36 (will be 37 at time of birth) and have a few (5) abortions under my belt.\u00a0\u00a0All were done surgically before 8 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I know that this sounds horrible but I need everyone to understand that at the time it was the right thing for me to do.\u00a0\u00a0I'm now in a loving/healthy relationship and want to have a baby with the man that I love.\u00a0\u00a0I do have one child who is a teenager and I have had one miscarriage.\u00a0\u00a0I also had preclampsia with my child and was induced a week early.I'm just concerned that given my history:* age (36/37) years old* 5 abortions* 1 miscarriage* preclampsia in previous pregnancyAm I able to possibly give birth to a healthy child? Or should I be seeing a high risk doctor?\u00a0\u00a0Should I be concerned about birth defects, etc.?I'm just in a state of panic and want to know if it's considered safe to carry a child with all that is under my belt and what are the odds of having a healthy pregnancy and baby?Once again, I did not come here to be judged for my past.\u00a0\u00a0I'm looking for as much support as possible for my future.Thank you all in advance!",
