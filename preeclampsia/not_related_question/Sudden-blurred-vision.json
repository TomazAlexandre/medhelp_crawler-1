It happened when my husband was leaving to go somewhere for the evening and i was going to stay with my 1 yr old. I had to call him to come back. Last night i was stressed and worried about my baby since i spotted a few times yesterday. Doctor checked me and saw i was fine and that it might be due to breastfeeding so i stopped the night breastfeeding last night. My 1 year old kept my husband and me awake all night. Very stressful. Woke up early to go to dr about spotting and then went to my 1 year olds dr appointment to get her 3 shots :( Then my inlaws came over for dinner. It has been a stressful day and im so exhausted. Im hoping thats just it. Because my blood pressure was fine and no protein in my urine. But if it doesn't happen again i will still mention it to my dr next week on my next appointment.\u00a0\u00a0I was just wondering if it happened to anyone and it was no big deal.",
