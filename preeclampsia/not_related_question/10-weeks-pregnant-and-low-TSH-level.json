What made you request your medical records? Did the Dr. say why he left you untreated? What were your blood results that stated you were hyper thyroid? Just TSH or T3 and T4 also?

Symptoms were increased heart rate, shortness of breath, irritability, fatigue, muscle weakness, since pregnanacy they have gotten intollerable that is why I insisted on a blood test. My OB say's it's nothing to worry about, my general practicioner did more labs but I am awaiting results. Is low TSH normal in pregnanacy? Do youthink I had this going on before pregnanacy?
