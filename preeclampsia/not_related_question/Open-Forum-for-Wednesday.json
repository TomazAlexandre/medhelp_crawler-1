I personally think it's up to each individual as to what they give thier child. They know their baby better than anyone and I know some are probably wetting their pants b/c Carrigan has had what she has at 8.5 months, but she's healthy and she liked it, so I thought no more about it.",

            "answer": "Cheese, ice cream and the like are actually different than regular milk. They are broken down a bit more when they are made into cheese, yogurt, ice cream, etc. Allergies are a concern as well as digestability. Babies under a year don't have a mature enough digestive tract to break it down and it can and usually does cause loose stools and gas. One glass of milk shouldn't be a problem, just keep an eye on him.With the allergies, it takes at least on exposure to it for you body to decide it is allergic to it, sucks huh? My son had been on an antibiotic once before and the second time he was on it, he developed welts. It took the first exposure to get things going. Same with many people and bee allergies, they get stung and have no ill effects, then down the road they get stung and suddenly they are in anaphylaxis. Good news is, just like someone mentioned, they usually outgrow a lot of those allergies. My older brother was allergic to 26 different things, went in for weekly allergy injections and made our life miserable (just kidding, we just had a lot of restrictions due to his allergies) He is now an adult and most of them have resolved. Peanuts are a scary allergy though, you have to be extra diligent. Good luck eating out, getting ice cream, etc.Small amounts of water are okay, before they are 2 months NO water. They have so little blood volume, even a small amount can lead to water intoxication (fancy way of saying severe electrolyte imbalance) which decreases the amount of potassium in their body, leading to death of cardiac muscle. Cinnamon, you work in geriatrics, right? Have you ever had a patient on Lasix (of course you have, or some form of diuretic) they always have to have a potassium supplement paired with it for the exact same reason. I used to have a patient who had OCD, I mean severe OCD. He wasn't allowed to have his cigarettes as he would down the pack in under 10 minutes, he couldn't have a water cup or urinal (portable kind) as he would drink and drink and drink and wind up in the hospital. Same concept, only babies don't have enough wiggle room. And there is also the concern about filling them up on empty calories, babies will rarely ever get dehydrated as long as they are fed regularly and kept cool.Cabbage leaves are great, but i did read to use them infrequently. There is an actual therapeutic proprty in them that is absorbed through the skin. Once daily use or so shouldn't be a problem. I think if you used them several times a day every single day there might be issues. I'll see if I can dig up the article. They worked wonders when I had mastitis in the beginning with Tristan. I never had to deal with engorgement like you ladies. Mine would only happen if we were out and about and I missed a feeding or started late. Tristan and Jonathan each only nursed off of the left side, so it was constantly being used. Never had time to build back up,lol!",

The last couple of months my periods have been so messed, that I keep thinking that I am pregnant. I even dream about it. My husband chuckles and says that is how hard I am wishing to be pregnant. I feel more symtoms of pregnancy in the last couple of weeks, but I think that it may all be in my head. Why do we Women put ourselves through this???? Will I always feel pregnant for the rest of my life. Or is this a late onset of post partum depression?\u00a0\u00a0I feel like a war veteran with a ghost baby inside. Am I crazy!!!!!",
