I'm 9 weeks tomorrow and have been basically.on my deathbed feeling so nauseated and throwing up. Mine will be in separate cribs just because I've heard that having them sleeping together increases the SIDS risk. But I found this cool Graco pack n play bassinet combo that have two little Moses baskets that snap into the top. I'll use that while they are little. They get to sleep side by side but still separate that way. We have a 2 yr old little boy and we were only planning on having two kids and surprise!\u00a0\u00a0Twins lol. So we're a but stressed about how to financially make it work but hey that's life!",

I think my office jumps the gun a bit and if your at all over 120/70 they diagnose you with it. I read twins and previous pregnancy hypertension are risk factors for getting it again. Yay! That's Me.
