Trisomy 13 is a genetic condition- your baby had this from the very day she was conceived. The doctor seemed to do all that was standard- u/s measurements with a follow-up when the baby measured small. She also sent you to be monitored as a precaution. Some physicians might not have even done that.Did you do the first trimester screening? Did it come up with you at an increased risk for downs? Even if it didn't, the doctor still wouldn't be at fault since these tests are not 100% accurate.I too would be beside myself if my little darling had such problems. My heart goes out to you. But you cannot blame anyone- yourself, the doctor, anyone... I hope you are receiving counceling to help cope with this,",

            "answer": "I agree with the other ladies.The doctor was monitoring you appropriately and delivered her early since your BP was elevated and her HB was not responding normally - these are both very dangerous situations for both mother and baby and can be fatal if action is not taken.As others have mentioned Trisomy is a rare condition that results from an error with DNA distribution during the conception process - it is no ones fault, not yours and not the doctors.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes these things go undetected as tests are not perfect.Im sorry for what you are going through.\u00a0\u00a0A friend of a friend of mine recently gave birth to a baby with Trisomy - they didnt know until baby was born either.\u00a0\u00a0The baby died several hours after birth.......",

I highly doubt that you'd have cause for a malpractice suit because you were well monitored throughout your pregnancy.The first trimester screening doctor's do has false negatives and false positives all the time. It's really not that accurate. Your doctor had no real cause for doing invasive testing for chromosome problems because she probably didn't see anything on the U/S.The only thing I\u00a0\u00a0can think of that should've been caught was the cleft lip. Ultrasounds only catch about %60 of physical chromosomal abnormalities. Spend your time with your little girl and cherish her.You should also have some testing to see if you or the baby's father carry any mosaic trisome 13 either. Because sometimes mosaic can result in a case so minor it causes no problems in the parent, however makes it a higher chance of having children with the trisome.",

It sounds like the docotr watched your baby well and even had her tested for stress then took her right away from the problems. I know how hurt you must be I lost my last daughter a few hours after birth. All I can say is to not make any big decisions for a year and just cherish the time you will be given. You do not want to put negative energy in the doctor and just all positive energy to your baby. That is what you both deserve. Wrap yopurself up in her and every moment you have.

    "question": "Ok, I gave birth my little girl on October 6th 2009. She weighted 3lb. and 1oz. and she was 16 inches long. My due date was November 8th 2009. I gave birth to her at 34 weeks and 5 days. My entire pregnancy my doctor said that my baby was progressing as normal and until Sept. 29th she said that I was measuring small. She did a weight ultrasound (and yes I understand that they are not that accurate) and she said that I measured a week small, but it was nothing to worry about. Then I was scheuled to go back to see her October 8th, but I was having really bad pain in my bottom (on October 6th). She said that I was still measuring small and did another weight ultrasound and she said that my baby had lost 12 oz. in 8 days ( but she said she didn't think it was accurate) so she sent me to the hospital for a fetul stress test. They put the straps around my belly and took my blood pressure and it was high. I laid there for about 2 hours and she said that everything looked good. Then my doctor suggested that the nurse buzz my belly (to startle my baby) and her heartrate dropped instead of going up. So she did an emergency c-section. My little girl went into respiratory distress was rushed to UAB (a learning hospital, a GREAT one at that). There she was diagnosed with Trisomy 13 Mosaic. 70% of her cells carry the trimosy gene and 30% does not. She had several congenital anomalies such as complete cleft lip on the right and partial cleft lip on the left, palpable cleft platate, clitoral enlargement, low set ears, microcephaly, hypotelorism, Flat nasal bridge, her neck was short with excess skin, short cternum with small nipples, long fingers, cataracts, rocker-bottom feet, and was SGA. After the doctor took my planceta out she said that it was small. My question is do I have a malpractice suite againist her? They have given my baby 6 months to live. I AM A WRECK!",
