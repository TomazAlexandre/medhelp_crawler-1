What it is from what I understand... a split in the utrice an can be corrected by a surgical procedure. It can cause m/c as well as premature labor. Unfortunately I didnt know I had it until the u/s tech found it at 6wks. I was on pins and needles the entire first trimester. What was really interesting is it doesnt seem to be a topic of concern in the last several visits. There are 3 types of septums of the uterice and this type is the better of he 3 to have.",

            "answer": "If you have a uterine septum (I'd ask for confirmation, one ultrasound is not enough, an HSG will tell you more), the problem is if the baby implants right on the septum.\u00a0\u00a0If so, there is usually not enough blood supply for an embryo, which creates a higher likelihood of a m/c.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise, according to my fertility doc, the septum gets pushed aside by the growing embryo and its amniotic sac, and doesn't cause problems.\u00a0\u00a0This might explain why some of your babies did fine and others didn't, but also keep in mind that miscarriage is usually for the baby's own reasons that have nothing to do with the mom's uterus, so maybe at least one or two of yours were from other issues independently of whether you have a septum.\u00a0\u00a0Septums can be removed, they are just soft tissue hanging down into the uterine cavity, but even that is not always necessary.\u00a0\u00a0The only time it would be worrisome is if you had a totally divided uterus, with a wall going down the middle that creates two halves.\u00a0\u00a0This reduces the space for the baby to grow, which is where the stories of preterm labor come from.\u00a0\u00a0But given your history, you don't have that! :)",

She was born exactly one week before my due date. About a year and a half later I had a miscarriage. A few months later I was pregnant with my son. He was also breech and I had a c-section a week before his due date. For the last 2 years we have been trying to get pregnant again with no luck. My ob/gyn did an HSG a couple of months ago and determined I had a bicorneate uterus and send me to a fertility specialist. The specialist did an ultrasound and determined my uterus was not bicorneate, but it was a septate uterus. Since I have had two successful pregnancies and just one miscarriage, he is not too concerned. He mentioned surgery, but doesn't think that is necessary. We haven't determined why I am having fertility issues now when we had no problem getting pregnant before. I had been taking Clomid, but recently began taking Femara for fertility. There is a risk of multiples, mainly twins with these drugs. I was wondering if it was even possible to carry twins with a septate uterus. Has anyone ever heard anything about that?",

she then sat me down, drew pictures to illustrate what this meant and discussed my options.\u00a0\u00a0The most concise and complete information I have found regarding congenital anomalies can be found at this link:http://www.gehealthcare.com/usen/ultrasound/education/products/cme_uterus.htmlIt took a lot of Googling about Septate Uterus, but I ended up with quite an education!\u00a0\u00a0In all my fertility and pregnancy books, \"uterine anomalies\" usually only had a few sentences and referred to endometriosis or fibroids.\u00a0\u00a0Congenital anomalies are more common than people think and unless you know what you are looking for, the available information is scarce.\u00a0\u00a0I just spent 3 hours in Barnes & Noble today and found only 2 books that referenced it in any detail.\u00a0\u00a0I am doing a lot more research into this and am planning on writing much more about it to post on other sites where people look for possible clues and answers, but felt compelled to share what I've learned so far with you now at 2:00 AM because I can relate to your anxiety.When my doc discovered this, the first thing that popped into my head was, \"Hallelujah!\u00a0\u00a0There is something my husband and I can do about it.\"\u00a0\u00a0BTW, my doc also checked out my ovaries and found many, many follicles waiting to become bebes!\u00a0\u00a0Another BTW, I am the eternal optimist: I was conceived after a miscarriage, I waited for many years to find the right man, got married in 2006 and am trying start a family.\u00a0\u00a0I am now 40 years old and my mother was 42 when my baby brother (now 30) was born - doc said that's good news for me.\u00a0\u00a0But, I digress.\u00a0\u00a0My second thought was, \"Why is this simple diagnostic test not being performed at least once during a routine gynecological exam in women before they suffer the pain of miscarriage or unexplained infertility?\"\u00a0\u00a0I intend to find out why or why not.The next step was to get an hystersalpingogram (HSG) to confirm my doc's diagnosis and to check if my Fallopian tubes are open (if they weren't, she could easily perform a Tuboplasty right then and there - similar to an Angioplasty in the heart).\u00a0\u00a0This involved scheduling between days 6 & 10 of my cycle (to allow the best view of the uterus) and the injection of contrast dye.\u00a0\u00a0My tubes looked great and the septum was clearly defined; it was larger than she had originally thought.\u00a0\u00a0BTW, any radiologic tech can perform an HSG, however, many times a misdiagnosis of bicornuate uteri is made.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, I had to pay $430 out-of-pocket because my doc was the one performing the HSG and the outpatient radiology place is not on my insurance's provider list - I was happy to pay it to have it done properly and will attempt to appeal the denied claim (will update on success).The next step was to schedule outpatient surgery (again between days 6 and 10 of my cycle) where my wonderful doc would essentially \"snip away\" the fibrous tissue that lacks a blood supply and therefore can cause recurrent miscarriage, placental problems and/or pre-term delivery and only allow a full-term baby 4.4% of the time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Initially, she was going to us a local anesthetic, but because the septum was broader than she had originally anticipated, it was necessary to use a general and intubate me for the procedure.My surgery was this past Friday, October 10th.\u00a0\u00a0It took less than an hour and my super doc said she basically snipped and the tissue pulled back like a spider web; she stopped when I started to bleed.\u00a0\u00a0Her job was to know how much to cut without perforating and when to stop.\u00a0\u00a0Bravo!\u00a0\u00a0I felt some cramping as I came around (probably from what they used to expand my uterus so she could see, either fluid or gas - I'm thinking it was gas), but a heating pad and Ibuprofen did the trick nicely.\u00a0\u00a0She advised, \"I can't put a band-aid on it or stitch you, so you may bleed for a few weeks, maybe until your next period.\"\u00a0\u00a0I've been home taking it easy all weekend... except for cabin fever late Saturday that made me suddenly want to stain the deck - I paid for it that night though.\u00a0\u00a0Aside from over-doing it, my only discomfort was a slightly sore throat from the LMA they used to tube me and that pain was gone Sunday afternoon after sucking on a few cough drops.All in all, I was never nervous and felt empowered that my husband and I could do something about this; he's been great!\u00a0\u00a0I have been bleeding bright red blood since Saturday night (wearing only panty liners), but there's been no pain and I will schedule my follow-up for 2-3 weeks from now - only light exercise now, so no kickboxing.\u00a0\u00a0Family has been sending care packages and I've resorted to box-kicking instead. haha\u00a0\u00a0Doc wants us to wait until after my next period before we resume sex and I'll ask her when we can start TTC again.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this information is helpful.\u00a0\u00a0The best advice I can offer is:* Ask questions.\u00a0\u00a0Write them down.\u00a0\u00a0Don't feel rushed - ASK them.\u00a0\u00a0If you are not satisfied with the answer, ask them again.* Be your own advocate.\u00a0\u00a0Educate and empower yourself.* You are ENTITLED to a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0It will not offend your doctor; if it does, find a better doctor with thicker skin.All the best.\u00a0\u00a0Oh, and this is from a very good friend of mine:{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{BABY VIBES}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}",

Sometimes early on in pregnancy the sac for multiples can not be seen clearly on U/S. I was carrying twins and the septum the u/s tech thought she saw was the early loss of one of my twins. I am still currently pregnant and I am due in 6wks. My obgyn did two ultrasounds since my visit to the hospital, one at 20wks and still have not seen a (bicornuate septum) in my uterus.

Getting pregnant took a long time and I also had three miscarriages before I finally carried my daughter to 38 weeks (This was our last go at starting a family). I had a lot of complications during my pregnancy, none of which were related to my misshaped uterus, so I was induced at 38 weeks. I was in labor for over 24 hours and I would not dilate past 5cm, so I had a C-Section. I'm not sure if the lack of dilating was a direct result of my uterus issues though.
