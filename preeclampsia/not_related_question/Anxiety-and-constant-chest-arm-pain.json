I often get these feelings, sometimes two or three times in a day, although the pains in the arm and chest aren't always there, I always feel as though I am on edge and that something bad is going to happen to me. I have been suffering from these symptoms for close on 4 years and nothing has changed, they haven't got better and thet haven't got worse. Been to the hospital on several occasions for ECG's etc and everyone comes back fine, eventually went to the doctor the other day and explained howmuch of an effect my condition was having on my day to day life. He prescribed me some Beta Blockers, Propranolol 40 mg tablets, have only been taking these for 2 days so am unsure if they are going to work!! Often wake up in the middle of the night feeling tightness across the chest and sometimes I feel like I have an armband around the biceps of both arms, like I said very frightening. Think that we are just some of the unlucky ones in life, although would love to be able to go through a day without havinf to worry about every little ache and pain being \"the big one\".....",

I know this is anxiety and I believe that I am feelinglike this because of my arm pain. About 5 weeks ago I found a lump in my left armpit and since the second I found it I was convinced that I was going to die, Thankfully it went away ina few weeks after a course of antibiotics but I worked myself up that much over it I think this is where the pain in my arm has come from... I am constantly thinking about it! I need to snap out of it, my doctor has given me anti-depressants but I want to try and sort myself out on my own! Any suggestions?",

Since then i have been tested for every desase known to man. Also im a us soldier that was supposed to be deployed for the 3rd time which gave me ample amounts of stress. But now im not getting deployed due to that and A-fib . I had 2 bouts of A-fib due to stress . Let me tell you , wow you can really feel like something is gonna happen or that i have a unknown diesase. I have had burning skin sensations , Sharp arm pain , chest pain , shoulder pain , back pain and my burning sensations were all over even tongue and throat . I also had a fear of having clots? for some reason lol .. i mean how could i get them in the first place. I get burning sensations from my chest to my finger tips up my neck like a sharp and cold stinging sensation it comes and goes . Well after all of this i was checked out by the best docters (military docters/Vetern) And im completely normal .. it has to do with the nervious system. And im on metropolol but by choice. besides that im on stoamach pills (nexium).BUT!! All of this is UNNESSARY. Everyone one of us have the same or almost same symptoms. Now think ppl we r all healthy (told by drs.) and we all have same problems. I finally got over anxiety attacks 2 weeks ago. If i can do this we all can . I have had support and no drugs so far and well Its very hard but like quiting smoking you can do it if you want. After you try very hard and cant try anymore you Still have to try alil harder. It will work ppl. You can do it. Like nike says .. Just do it ! So !! -- With all my symptoms and feelings and er visits , I learned that anxiety is a pain in the behind but you can over come it and live witht out it . Even in less then 30 min you can tell your self no more im done with this. and totally ignore it. it worked for me so far. and eventully (depends on how bad you have it ) it will go away and you will be happy agin . lol i remember 1 time i couldnt even sleep laying down i set up all night next to my wife for the fear of a heart attack ,i look back and laugh at my self for being like that lol at the time it wasnt funny though lol im a infantry soldier and i was still scarded to death. You guys will be alright lets all start living .. only one life lets have fun :) and make the best of it. WE ARE NOT SICK!!\u00a0\u00a0Its in our heads we just have to get it out.",

            "answer": "Hello Everyone,Wow these posts are helping me tremendously. I am 29 and I starting experienceing my first bouts of anxiety at 23. I thought it was a heart attack. Went to the doctor and all the tests were normal. I think I might have the hiatal hernia as well. I have had a stress echo and many EKG's this year. All came back normal. Thank goodness. I work out too so that does help somewhat. Much like everyone else, I wondered if the workouts were making the condition worse. But I have decided to work out because it's been determined that it's not my heart. I just started having the arm pain like 3 days ago. I guess that's the progression of it. I do not want to take anything for it because I would like to overcome it psychologically if possible. But sometimes the pain is unbearable. Also, I'm in school to be a PA and any class discussing the physiological effects of the body totally freak me out....I have to get through this. I think I might start a yoga class and try some meditation. I'm praying that we are all freed from this anxiety. Remember mind over matter. We can do this. Thanks to everyone for posting.-Risa",

            "answer": "PalpitationsPalpitations are short, abrupt periods in which the heart suddenly starts beating fast. If you\u2019re in a sensitive state, this can ring alarm bells because you fear a sudden heart attack. The more you panic, the faster the heart beats. It\u2019s therefore understandable why many people in this situation jump to conclusions and call for medical help. What you have to remember is that palpitations are perfectly natural and can often be caused by exhaustion or stimulants like caffeine. Your heart is an incredibly strong muscle, and it won\u2019t stop or explode simply because it\u2019s beating hard and fast. A healthy heart can beat fast all day long and not be in any danger.Missed HeartbeatsThe medical term for missed heartbeats is extrasystoles. A missed heartbeat is usually an extra beat between two normal beats. Given the pause that follows this premature beat, it just seems as if one beat was missed. And because the heart\u2019s lower chambers fill with a greater-than-usual amount of blood during the pause, the next regular heartbeat can feel like a bit of a jolt. When you feel this sensation, you often freeze and wait in terror to see if your heart is in trouble.Such missed beats are generally harmless. It can help to sit down when you feel this sensation, but if you wish to keep moving, do so. Exercise won\u2019t cause the situation to get worse, and don\u2019t convince yourself that going home to lie down is the only way to help the situation. If you retreat every time you feel an unusual sensation, that behavior can reinforce a negative idea that your home is the only safe place to be. Our hearts are not atomic clocks that always keep time; they speed up, slow down, or occasionally beat in an irregular fashion. People with anxiety are very keen observers of all bodily functions. From time to time, you may notice an irregular beat or two. This is nothing to get upset about.Sometimes, individuals go through similar worries about their heart as they do with their breathing. People convince themselves that if they worry enough about their heart, or concentrate too much upon its actions, it may somehow get confused and forget how to beat correctly. It\u2019s quite common for people who suffer from panic attacks to check in on their heart at regular intervals to make sure it\u2019s still beating away.If you simply can\u2019t stop obsessing about your heart, here are some tips:\u2022 Get a full medical examination. If you don\u2019t, your mind will always bring up the \u201cwhat if something really is wrong\u201d card. When you get a clean bill of health, trust in the results and don\u2019t second-guess them. If you really must, get a second opinion\u2014but after that, stop doubting your good health.\u2022 Remember that your body has incredible internal intelligence. Simply telling your heart, out of panic, that it might stop doesn\u2019t mean that it heeds your fears. Learn to become more comfortable with your heart, and let it do its job. Listen to it when you\u2019re relaxed and also when you\u2019re exercising. The more comfortable you are with the diversity and range of your heartbeats, the more confidence you\u2019ll have in it.\u2022 Allow your heart to beat in whatever rhythm it sees fit. Don\u2019t try to control the natural rhythms of your body by always insisting on a calm heartbeat. The more you allow your body to flow in the manner it so chooses, the faster it will return to a state of rest.Very often, your heart only wants to palpitate a bit, thump a few beats harder. Why? That\u2019s the heart\u2019s own business. It\u2019s your mind that interferes and panics, causing the adrenaline to kick off a longer cycle of rapid heartbeats. So from now on, make a verbal agreement with your heart that you\u2019re going to stop interfering and obsessing over its health and trust in it 100 percent. Then hand over the controls. Let go to whatever way your heart wishes to behave. By allowing the sensations to happen and simply getting on with your day, you release the anxiety that you hold around your heart as well as the cautious monitoring of every heartbeat.",

            "answer": "For 2 years off and on, I've been experiencing left arm and hand aches; worse in 2007.\u00a0\u00a02 years ago when it started it was the worse as I had left chest aches, left arm and hand pain, irregular heart beat, extreme fear, and dizzingness especially for a few days following a few Korean or Chinese beers which are undoubtebly full of bad chemicals. Funny thing, I learned I get this from Asian beers, but not from German and microbrew beers.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a hardcore alcoholic, but I like to enjoy a 6 pack once a week such as on Friday night or the night before a holiday off work. I went through 6 months of these symptoms in 2007, then a couple months in Spring 2008, and then recently for the past 4 months off and on without drinking or smoking anything.I get terrified by any left arm, hand, or chest ache, but don't show classic signs of heart disease such as angina when doing physical work like climbing up stairs, getting hot and sweaty in the gym, and climbing up 4000 to 6000 feet mountains. No chest pains, no arm pains while exercising. I always feel better from excersize, but nights can be sleepless and making me exhausted.\u00a0\u00a0When I'm exhausted, lacking sleep, and forced to get up too early, I have more left side, left arm aches and sometimes feeling of weak and terrified of failing.With being 35 years old and knowing my dad had his 1st heart attack at 35, died at 54, and his dad dropping dead at 42 to heart attack from blocked arteries, I'm scared I've been dealt a premature death sentance. My 36 year old brother also has coronary heart disease and is on SSI disability already, but is grossly over weight, did a lot of meth in his days, went to prison twice for stealing, and smokes heavily anything he can get his hands on. He's a thief always trying to sick the police on you when you don't let him rip you off. Needless to say, I've experienced a great deal of fear and anxiety resulting from my dysfunctional family and lack of love of support, but I'm strong in that I just have to keep trucking on through life on my own. I must be experiencing anxiety over economic uncertainty, dysfunctional relatives I've had to bail out of trouble over their irresponsibilities, fear of going broke, and a general sense of lacking security.I live very differently than my parents, grand parents, and brothers in that I avoid milk, cheese, fatty meats, fried foods, don't do drugs, got a high school and college education, served in the military, get regular physical exercise 6 days a week, and look very good. Me and my brother are like night and day. I hope I avert the heart disease disaster by being contrarian to my relatives, but I know I take on a hell of a lot of pollution. It's hard for anyone to believe me when I express concern I could be coming down with CAD as I look good and am strong and healthy otherwise. I'm still single; not settled down, not in a relationship since teenager years, don't plan on having kids, live and work abroad in Asia, and enjoy traveling to many countries.My blood pressure was found to be high 2 years ago at 155/105, but I didn't receive ACE inhibitor pills until last August which lowered it to normal levels, but this didn't make me feel any better. I know to keep it in check as that's really bad for your heart, arteries, and everything else. I'm only 10 pounds overweight, but very physically strong and healthy otherwise. These left arm left hand and sometimes left chest pain aches come unexpectably and the fear sets in.What terrified me about these left side aches is possible heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0I reasoned that if it were anxiety, why didn't I experience this anxiety in my 20's during the extreme stresses of army life and then times of extreme dire straights?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe my 35 year old mind is weaker to anxiety inducing stresses like economic uncertainty and the stresses of work and career and relatives I'm not proud of.I took a 1 month vacation to Thailand last month and just felt aweful most days feeling left side aches and fear of heart attack, but upon return to Korea where I work, I immediatly started feeling fine the day I flew back through symptom returned within a week so I went to a doctor. A year prior, I felt like a million dollars during a 2 month trip to Cambodia, Laos, and the Gulf of Thailand south islands, but upon return home to the states, I got horrible symptoms from day 1 upon being around my mother having serious mental issues and trying to committ suicide by hydrocodone overdose which I averted by taking her to the ER with a BP of only 50/30. When I left home in the states again last June for Asia again, the symptoms went away, but returned in September.\u00a0\u00a0The pattern and symptoms indicate an anxiety disorder in itself, but CAD must be ruled out first. It's perplexing as I would think I'd felt this in my teens and 20's too if I'm suseptable to anxiety disorder as my early years were very difficult and stressful due to the lack of finances. I still don't have a lot of finances and am facing economic uncertainty as the economy tanks, but that's par for the course in our time.\u00a0\u00a0This is not mom and dads time period where you inherit money, house, and a good stable job.2 days ago, I went to the doctor, EKG checked out healthy as a young bull, given nitro pills to test if it releaves arm aches which it seemed to despite the resulting tremendous headache, and given a Beta blocker and mild benzodiazapines which seem to have relaxed me in reducing fear and not feeling like I'm going to have a heart attack. My blood cholesterol is a low 150 due to giving up milk, fried foods, meat with visible fat, and eggs 2 years ago for fear of fat clogging my arteries.\u00a0\u00a0 I was told 10 years ago my cholesterol was a very high 300 back when I chugged milk, munched cheese, fried lots of catfish and zuchini, was 30 pounds overweight, and just gorged on anything late at night not yet realizing it's not OK to do that.I'm going Monday for further heart testing at a larger hospital in the big city in attempt to find out if I have and how bad arterial schlerosis is inside my body.\u00a0\u00a0With my left arm aches, extreme fear at night and sometimes at work, and my family history of heart disease, I've been so convinced I've got a partially blocked artery or CAD, but don't show classic symptoms of angina during physical exertion. I only wish I could go talk to my dad and grandpa to find out more of what they felt like, but they're long gone dead many years ago from blocked arteries causing fatal heart attacks. Even both of my grandmothers succombed to blocked coratid arteries leading to stroke where they to be sadfully put down or euthonized by starvation when they couldn't no longer be concious and feed themselves. My mother had congestive heart failure 1 year ago, but is surviving though lost a few of her marbles.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say, she's moving into an assisted living unit this Spring which deeply saddens me that she won't be able to continue to enjoy the roses I planted in the front yard of her public housing apartment 2 years ago. She's just getting too weak and forgetful to do her own house work, cook, shop, and get around.\u00a0\u00a0She's on all those heart meds and has always suffered severe anxiety and depression, but has been medicated for years.\u00a0\u00a0She never worked as she was in a wheel chair since 17 due to breaking her back during the 1st ride in a car with her 1st boyfriend.Any drugs that can disolved plaque in the arteries to cure arterioschlerosis or for preventative maintenance?\u00a0\u00a0This is my priceless question as this would be the holy grail of curing CAD. Lipitor is rumored to disolved arterial plaques, but I don't have any of these pills.\u00a0\u00a0I know back in my dads and grandpas time, they're wasn't much more technology than nitroglycerin pills while today, we have beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, benzos, and cholesterol reducing drugs.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for sharing your feelings. I can't explain how great is feels to know I am not alone in my struggle with terrible anxiety. Always worried, hypersensitive, never trusting the doctors and tests, afraid of dying.. I'm sorry others have to feel this pain.. this prison.. but knowing there are others strong enough to share and even offer help to others like me gives me strength.I'm 24 years old and have had anxiety and panic disorders my entire life. Everyday I pray I can win the struggle to stay functional and baseline. It takes so much strength and focus to just appear normal a lot of the times and the days that I actually do feel safe and strong and secure are such a blessing. I take nothing for granted anymore. I appreciate everything beautiful about life, especially my loving wife and great friends/family. Because of the love and support of family, friends, and others like me sharing their thoughts and feelings - I feel like I might just be ok.Thank you all so much. I'm in tears right now from the sense of release in knowing I can beat this that I AM ok. I can't really explain it but this just really gives me strength. A lot of the times I just feel crazy because I feel like as much as family and friends and doctors/therapists try to help its like they don't really understand. I know you guys do. Completely. So in a way it is a new kind of comfort. I will always be thankful for those that are there for me, especially my wife who has given so much for me.. but like I said this is like a support group for me in a way I guess.I'll stop rambling.. thanks again. I wish everyone the best of luck and the happiest of futures. I hope you have many calm days ahead.",

            "answer": "I've been taking a beta blocker and Clobazam, a derivative of benzo, since March with no change along with my ACE inhibitor with my blood pressured controlled around 110/65 and 60 to 70 resting BPM. I'm still working out 5 days a week and seeing cardio and muscular gains over the months. I almost always feel good when exercising, standing, walking, hiking, cycling, working and anything else on my feet regardless how tiring and sweaty it is. The harder the better, but when I sit down at night, I get dull left arm/hand aches and sometimes mild chest pain. I often don't feel comfy laying down, but seem to feel my heart working harder to beat, especially laying on my back. I prefer sleeping on my left side. Oddly, 3 weeks ago, one morning at 7am, I was having a dream I had just arrived in the states after doing a 1.5 year round the world trip to find I was so jet lagged I had acute chest pain. I do not know if I was actually experiencing the chest pain while dreaming, because it seemed so real, but I immediately woke up and no pain. As you can imagine this makes it hard to go to bed. I wonder how common this is? I'm not seeing a whole lot of posts on these boards, but there's a handful. I quit drinking altogether which didn't help, but I'm worse a day or two after when I did have a drink.\u00a0\u00a0I drank twice in the past 3 months and I thought the hangover was going to kill me as the dull aches were worse so I avoid drinking situations and enjoy the savings as it's not cheap to drink.I am working overseas and haven't been home in 14 months and anticipate I'll be back in October so that 1.5 year round the world trip is my reality as I'm planning to do some traveling into the Fall season. This dream 3 weeks ago was the realest dream I ever had. Back in March, 2008, I was in Southeast Asia for a few months after working in Korea for a year, felt great and normal during my tropical vacation, but when the next day after landing in LAX, I had chest and left arm pain with severe exhaustion or jet lag. I went to bed that afternoon after walking around in Hollywood, slept like 14 hours, got up,(went nutz at Denny's on Sunset eating American high fat heart attack food) and had a great day at Universal Studios Hollywood. Even road all the rides, including the Mummy roller coaster with heart warnings at the entrance with no ill effects. 2 days later, I flew to St. Louis to visit home and the symptoms returned a day after that flight. I went through 1 month of it until I joined a gym. No more symptoms again until last August. I had EKG, stress test, and chest xray done back in March of this year with normal results. Unlike in 2008 where working out prevented it, working out no longer prevents symptoms, but I know it's good for me. I thought if it was anxiety, I would had suffered this back in my 20's as I had a very hard 20's when it came to money, military duty, and issues with greedy selfish relatives. It's quite a miracle if it's true I am as healthy as I look, because these dull ache symptoms in my left arm and most often, hand make me cringe.Of course I'm scared with heart disease running deeply in my family, but I don't live like them. I'm educated, don't smoke, work out regularly, eat lots of healthy foods like salmon and fresh veggies/fruit, rice, and not grossly over weight like they were. Well, I'm totally different in mind and body than them. Just 30 pounds over for my height which are tough to lose. I'm not a steak and fries eater nor hamburgers nor any pastries nor any of those bagged snacks nor Zingers as those sorts of things have hydrogenated shortening. My 38 year old brother has already had heart attack and stroke, but he's 350 pounds, just sat the past 8 years on disability over his back from factory work, and looks awful. Ironically, when they started taking $400 a month for child support 4 months ago, he's laying roof under the table, but time will only tell if he can actually handle it. I still look young, can handle long walks, even up mountains, lifting weights, and anything, but feel better when on my feet unless exhausted due to badly needing sleep. I wanna sleep in the morning; not at night, but must get up for work. On days I was just too tired and needed sleep, I get left arm and sometimes chest dull pains regardless of position or activity. This is not bad pain, just very mild dull ache that comes and goes, but it worries me.\u00a0\u00a0I've never had tightness in chest nor shooting severe pains. Doctor said to forget it when I talk about heart anything, but that's not good enough to personally clear me.\u00a0\u00a0I want that 64 slice scan done to get a visual on my arteries to see if I have blockage requiring angioplasty, but the machine is not available in my local area. When I was growing up, I did eat food fried in shortening, was around smoking parents, smoked a few years, and ate anything, but was never obese. They say after 5 years of getting away from all that, you're as good as a nonsmoker who never ate junk food. I find taking a drink of water at night helps me and then I relax and finally fall asleep. I drink about 1 gallon a day most days very rarely drink soda and other sugary drinks. The only oil in my house for the past 2 years is extra virgin. Even corn oil and deep fat frying of any sort is out of bounds. Only a tiny bit of milk for morning coffee and things like cheese and eggs only on rare occasion. That's why my cholesterol is low.\u00a0\u00a0What's wrong? I know I'm not imagining these dull aches. I know we all need instant full body scan high tech machines like on Star Trek due to our level of knowledge as unprecedented knowledge and hyper-ultra sensitive awareness of our bodies and the world may very well be our excess burden. So we need the who sheebang; not just talking to doctors and doing EKG's.",

            "answer": "I have been having weird arm pains for almost a year. I first noticed last year that my left arm would ache after I would smoke a cigarette. It wouldn't happen all the time but it has continued to happen. Over the last few weeks it has gotten so much worse. I've had EKG's this year with a physical and they \"say\" my heart is fine. But I'm not convinced. I also have really sharp pains on the left side of my chest but am not sure of it's origination (rib cage/intercostal muscles, breast pain, or cardio issues). I am currently trying to stop smoking since it is such a horrible thing to do anyway but it is a very hard (14 year) habit to break. I have been on anti-depressants because of anxiety and Panic Attacks for 3 years. Zoloft worked for the 1st two years and then I had to switch to Lexapro this last April because the Zoloft turned on me. Now after 6 months on the Lexapro I have weaned myself off of the anti-depressants all together. I am struggling but really only have the worst anxiety at night. I have had horrible insomnia since May and stay up til the wee hours of the morning and sleep most of the day. I lay in bed at night in fear that I'm gonna have a heart attack because of the various aches and pains in my chest, arm, stomach, etc. It's the most frustrating thing in the world! I feel better at times by reading other peoples posts but find it hard to believe that so many people suffer from the same experiences with no real answers other than \"it's anxiety\". I recently started seeing a Psychiatrist and I am just not sure it's worth my time or money. I got Mirtazapine first. I took that for 1 night and was \"stoned\" for 24 hours. I slept like a baby and did not experience the somatic issues (i.e. aches and pains, racing thoughts) that I normally feel from the anxiety at night but the next day I was in a stoned stupor and could not function as well as I needed to. Next I was given Klonipin. Told to start out on a very small dose (1/8 of a mg) as I am very sensitive to all drugs. All this seemed to do was give me more anxiety and heart palpatations and faster heart beat. Called my psych to tell her what happened with that drug and she has not returned my calls. So I feel completely uncompelled to up the dosage to 1/4 mg. Psychiatrists are so flakey! Or at least mine is. She completely missed the 2nd appointment that we had scheduled. Now if I had missed the appointment I would have been charged for a full session. Where's my compensation?? So at 30 years old I am terrified of medications, terrified of my heart giving out from all the years of strain I have done to it with alcohol and cigarettes, and can't sleep. This is not a way to live. I have quit drinking (except for maybe 2 drinks at the most -- once a month), tried to cut out MSG and aspertame (as this can affect my anxiety), no caffiene, and just trying to eat better in general and taking supplements (albizzia calm, omega 3-6-9 oils, magnesiem)-- which seem to be helping but a very slow process as I introduce them each individually (next is a B-complex) and slowly to see what works best. I've also started acupuncture and continuing to see my wonderful chiropractor for the pains that I experience (which ironically there is aways something out of alignment that can explain the pains I'm experiencing). I just want to say that no matter how debilitating it can be, I think there's hope, you just have to find what works best for you. As time passes, I have had to change with it because what worked for the first few years (zoloft and talk therapy), is not working now. It seems that the anxiety evolves in my body and takes on different forms over time. I'm getting a referral to a cardiologist to put my mind at ease, hopefully once and for all. Then I'm ready to find my next step. I'm just ready to live again and stop living in fear that I'm going to drop dead any freakin' minute. Stay strong people and BELIEVE in yourself!",

            "answer": "I've been suffering depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, probably even as a young child (3 or 4 years of age). My symptoms have recently become more pronounced as I started university and work etc.Anxiety chest pains have been a big thing for me, and they've been getting increasingly worse over the last few months (pain over my heart area, pain in my neck and then up and down my left arm.. tingling, weakness) needless to say, I freak out every time I have one of these episodes and think that it's the big one.. that I'm having a heart attack and will be dying shortly. I've been to numerous doctors and have had blood tests, ECGs, you name it. Each time, tests come back with nothing. My doctor has even said that my heart is \"perfect\". I can accept that all these symptoms are anxiety related but the train of thought that develops in my head when I experience one of these episodes is debilitating and frightening.Anyway, just wanted to share my experience on this forum. It is comforting to know that I'm not the only one out there experiencing these symptoms.I am seeking help with ongoing counselling as well as looking up resources on the net. I work hard every day to stay positive, keep fit and to \"untwist my thinking\" and stop obsessing about my health. It's tough! But I'd say most days are manageable, some days are great, other days are bad.Keep positive people and don't give up learning new strategies and take it easy on ourselves, never think that you're a failure and that you'll be living with this condition forever. You just gotta pick yourself up and keep at it.",

I went to the doctors in early October and to be honest, he made me feel worse.He said basically, do something to get over it and forget about it. Not to mention bringing me to tears. I'd been having crying tendencies a few days before and on the day of the doctors visit.Somewhere in his little speech, he attempt to reassure me 21 years olds don't have heart attacks. He said the aches were probably muscular due to what I had been doing a couple of weeks previously.The aches did fade away and I had no problems however, over the past few days they have returned and I feel they are worse than the previous bout.Especially in the nights. I really cannot sleep with the fear of not waking up in the morning.An example: last night, I was up going to the loo, vomitting and when I returned to bed I started shivering. I was literally jumping from being cold, whilst the arm and chest aches worsened - sometimes it felt like pain. I just did not want to sleep.This morning I still have the aches alot, including my back and I was sick again.I am trying to understand that it's all in my head but with the constant ache in the worst possible places it's hard to do.It's horrible, and making me cry.I would return to the doctors but we can't choose who we see so I'd likely see him for a second time.And I just don't know what to do. I don't think I can take it.",

I feel like the only one in the world who has these problems and doubting doctors, etc. I have been through so much in the past half a year with these weird chest pains. They manifest themselves in different ways and are very scary! Sometimes they feel like horrible cramps over my heart that make me almost feel faint or sick to my stomach. I quit my job when this happened to me at work, and left for the ER. They did an EKG (which I had already had done and was normal) and a chest x-ray. Normal again. They sent me to a gastrologist and they thought it was my gall bladder. I then had my gall bladder taken out (which caused wayy more anxiety as one can imagine!) and now taht its been out for 6 weeks the pain has returned. I noticed that this pain originially started this summer when I was having bad panic attacks over a hard college course. But the pains in my chest don't happen DURING the attacks, they randomly come on later, sometimes even a day later. I feel like it has to be anxiety, but like many of you have said, its impossible to convince my brain of this. I keep thinking theyre not finding something, but I am only 22 and 112 pounds and try to work out as much as possible. I feel like if I had heart problems i would fall over and die when I work out. I still want to go to a Cardiologist just to rule out everything even though Ive had EKG's. This problem has also made me slightly agorophobic. Like Im afriad to go out and go to parties because Im afraid the pain will strike! This is sad that Im a college student and can't even let myself have fun! I want to live again and all of this has caused me to be grumpy all the time and sad and cry. I think I've developed mild depression. Sorry this is so long! Feel free to input, anyone.",

            "answer": "I came across these postings while trying to research my symptoms like I do every time I am experiencing something with my body that is freaking me out. Usually what I find makes me feel worse and terrified and I end up making a trip to the ER, but this time after reading this I am definitely feeling a lot better!! I have been having the exact same problem with chest and arm pains for about a month now and as much as I feel so bad others have to experience it, it comforts me to know I'm not the only one. I have a history of anxiety starting from when I was 15. I was on antidepressants for a couple years and was slowly weened off with the help of a therapist. My anxiety was under control for a long while there and I even managed a stressful 3 years of university with no problems. Currently 21 and in my 4th and graduating year I feel like I have been experiencing a lot more stress lately.My chest pains started about a month ago on the left side of my chest as sharp stabbing pains. Not extremely painful but very irritating. I was also experiencing heart flutters, skipped beats and palpitations a lot more often than normal. The pain immediately made me anxious but I managed to ignore it for a week hoping it would disappear. Finally the discomfort got to me too much and I decided to go to the ER. I had all the typical tests for these problems, EKG, xray, bloodwork etc and everything came out fine other than that I have a mild irregular heartbeat which is apparently not dangerous. The doctor told me that the chest pain was probably an inflamed membrane or cartilage in my chest and told me to take ibuprofen for the pain. With the pain in my left side continuing intermittently for another week after this I was not convinced at all that I was ok.I was at work one night (serving at a restaurant) and the pain became so bad that I had to ask my manager if i could sit down and rest for a minute. Instead of the sharp stabbing in the left side that I was used to, this pain was in the center of my chest and was more of a severe burning aching feeling right over my heart. I was terrified I was having a heart attack and had to leave work to go to the hospital. The doctor monitored my heart rate and blood pressure for a few hours but refused to do more tests since he said they did so many the first time I was there. Again I was told everything was fine and that the pain was an injury and the rest was anxiety and was sent home. The very next night the pain was so bad I couldn't sleep. I got out of bed about an hour after I had gotten in and noticed that both my neck and leg hurt and they were both swollen..this being a new symptom I immediately freaked out again thinking I had blood clots and went back to the hospital. I had the same doctor as the night before who agreed to do more blood work. Same thing...tests fine. The worst experience of my life was when this doctor tells me that it is all in my head!! He said that because I am a psychology student the things I am studying are getting to me and creating these symptoms. If you've experienced this you know it is not in your head!! The pain is very very real and very scary. I was so fed up with the health care system and insensitivity of the doctors I had seen I told myself i was going to ignore the pain from now on.I am very aware that a lot of my symptoms with chest tightness and heart racing are from my anxiety because I have experienced it before in my life but it is sooo hard to accept that anxiety can actually cause you physical pain!\u00a0\u00a0Knowing that other people are feeling the same way is helping me trust more what the doctors have said. Recently the pain has continued and been right in the center with the burning feeling and sometimes on the left side with the sharp stabs. It has also been radiating through my shoulder neck and left arm and fingers. My arm has also felt weak and tingly. With my heart constantly racing and skipping beats it has made me afraid to exercise or really do anything that increases my heart rate because it feels like it will stop beating. I noticed many people saying that the pain goes away with exercise but I am definitely the opposite! My chest kills and tightens and makes it hard to breathe. Probably anxiety as someone else mentioned. It is very debilitating not feeling comfortable with exercise as I am normally a very active person. What really made me laugh was the post that said a person with a panic disorder will constantly stop and monitor their heart rate to make sure it is still beating properly. I do that at least twice a day!! I am really hoping that with this knowledge from all of you I can beat this! It is still very scary when I feel how real and physical the pain is and especially the weakness and pain in my left arm. It will definitely be a process to overcome it. Sorry about the long winded explanation it just feels very good to get this all out in the open! In fact my chest feels a lot less tight than it did 15 minutes ago when I began writing this. Thank you all for sharing your stories and feelings it has been very helpful to me.",

I felt a loss of control and thought I was going to pass out. I was having a very stressful week. My wife is pregnant and she was spotting(she and the babies are fine), my brother went to the emergency room(he is fine) and work is always very stressful. I am in senior management position and have alot of responsilbilities which can get to me. Since that day I have tightness in my chest on and off and pain in my left arm. I went to many different doctors for EKG's and stress test and they said I am very healthy so must be stress. I thought after getting a clean bill of health I would feel better but I still have anxiety pretty regularly. They put me on 10mg of paxil which I do not believe is doing anything and I am speaking to someone now as well. My doctor wants to be me on 10mg of Lexapro instead of Paxil. What is everyone's thoughts on that? What about vitamin B complex and B12? Of course when I exercise or I am completely distracted I feel fine but if I have time to think I get anxiety.It does make me feel good hearing so many people going through what I am going through but I it doesn't help when I am going through an anxiety attack. I just want to get control back of my life especially that I am going to be a father soon too. Any advise would be greatly appreciated.",

I do have a fast heart rate and get PVCs as well, but the docs try to convince me that I'm fine. Basically it causes me all sorts of anxiety when I think about what could possibly be wrong with my heart and if it is going to hurt me. This makes the pains worse and it turns into a horrible cycle.Anyway I wanted to let you know that I started on Cipralex about a month ago which is basically the same as Lexapro, they're both escitalopram. It has worked wonders for me. I still get anxious thoughts but it has been a while since I have had the pains and the bodily symptoms that i struggled with for months. It is worth a try! I have also started taking B12 vitamins (because I was found to be a bit low on it), so I don't know if that has helped me as well or if its just the meds, but it couldn't hurt. I know the feeling of being stuck in that dark hole, like there is no escape. But there is, and you WILL feel better eventually. Good luck with everything!",

It may all be tied to your stomach. You could try eliminating the stomach problems and maybe the rest of the symptoms will go away like my friend. from my understanding there are 2 types of Gerd problems. not enough stomach acid or too much. Personally, i like to use natural remedies to avoid other symptoms due to side effects but that is totally your call. if it is not enough acid then you could try apple cider vineger or pickles and see if that helps. if it gets worse then it would be too much acid and there are natural ways to take care of that too. Alot of it is life style changes that all of us have problems doing and\u00a0\u00a0i believe most doctors will state that but they know that most of us will not take that advise so they give us stomach meds which can help relieve the too much acid problem because they block some of the acid that your stomach makes. BUT..... if they are used for a long duration, it could cause worse things to happen because your body uses that acid to help in the digestive department and you could start to lose valuable nutrient that you get from food and are more likely to develope other problems like osteoperousis and etc. So personally, I perfer lifestyle change along with some help from some natural herbs that you can find at local back to nature shops. yes anxiety can cause all sorts of pains in all sorts of places but what causes the anxiety. Maybe the stomach? What causes the stomach problems? Maybe lifestyle? maybe food alergy or intolorence? If we figure out the root cause maybe we'll fix all of it.",

I have been thinking i'm dieing of a heart attack, blood clot, stroke, brain tumors, cancer, and what ever else you could possibly imagine and i have been over looking the real problem right along with the doctors this whole time. I dont know if it is actually acid reflux, gallbladder or what that is causing it but it is definetly coming from my stomach when i started having an attack i treated it like a stomach problem and it subsided. who would have thought that some stomach acid could cause you to feel like you are having a heart attack or cant catch your breath or heart palpatations and nearly fainting.\u00a0\u00a0DO me a favor and go to one of these Gerd forums and read those peoples symptoms and see just how close they are to yours. You can even hear the anxiety pooring out of them. We are the same people.

I am happy to say that i have been able to live anxiety free without anxiety medication though and i suffered with it\u00a0\u00a0for nearly ten years or more, So for some people it might be in there best interest to look into this. Can we agree on that?",

            "answer": "By conditions that mimic anxiety, I mean things like thyroid disorders, other hormone imbalances, diabetes, etc.\u00a0\u00a0These conditions can actually mimic panic attacks, when in reality, it is the symptoms of these diseases that are causing those same sensations.\"Trigger\" and \"cause\" may be similar in some respects, I agree.\u00a0\u00a0When speaking of \"cause\", I was thinking more along the lines of the many professional speculations as to how anxiety disorders originate.\u00a0\u00a0There is believed to be a genetic component, possible chemical imbalances, and so on.I'm glad you found some answers for yourself.\u00a0\u00a0I think if there is any kind of connection between something like GERD and anxiety, it would be the uncomfortable symptoms that create anxiousness, and once that anxious cycle of thinking starts....it becomes hard to stop.\u00a0\u00a0Just like a person with panic attacks aren't actually fearful of the grocery store they HAD a scary attack in, but rather, they fear the sensations and begin to relate those symptoms with the store itself.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully you get what I mean, it's a bit hard to explain.I just don't want anxious people reading this to think that their GERD (which is a very prevalent issue for many) is the \"cause\" of their anxiety and therefore forego important treatment to address the anxiety itself.\u00a0\u00a0Certainly if someone has GERD, it should be treated.Anyway, thanks for sharing your experiences and I'm glad you found relief!",

            "answer": "It is definetly important to control the anxiety. I myself had to take medication for years. I did not mean to come across as someone who is totally against medication but i also know that the medical field is a practice and does not always no the cause or triggers therefore not always diagnosing it correctly. For me, it helped to pinpoint it to one certain thing instead of 100 different things like all the what if's that run through our heads. Like am i having a heart attack? no it's the gerd. do i have\u00a0\u00a0cancer? no it's the gerd. do you see how that helped with my anxiety? i did not have all thoughs what if's anymore. i had one culprit i could blame it on and that in itself eased my anxiety even if i was wrong, i was right. I know this might not apply to everyone because we are not all the same but by establishing the thought that anxiety is a disease all in itself rather than a symptom of something else tends to strengthen it's authority in our lives, \"At least for me\", but maybe that helps some people and if it helps then do what you must.\u00a0\u00a0I somewhat agree with the chemical imbalance theory because that is exactly what is happening with Gerd. our body is either making to much acid or not enough therefore throwing the body out of sinc. The heraditary theory is plausable too and i say this because i have a few people in my family that deal with anxiety but they also have Gerd and other stomach issues which alot of doctors say the anxiety and stress cause the stomach problems but what if it is the other way around? It works for me. it really, really, really, works for me and it is starting to work for some of my other family members also. There are alot of people, i'm sure that suffer with anxiety that don't have Gerd so you can't tie it to that and i totally understand that. it wouldn't make sinse but i do have gerd and it is the cause/trigger and when i say i had anxiety it was not the mimic form. it was the real deal, full blown, think i'm dieing, rush to the hospital because my body was all contorted from hyperventaling, doctors running gazillions of test just to tell you that your fine and it's all in your head, walk around in a daze or like you don't belong in your own body, scared to go anywhere, cant hold down a job without the medication and barely doing that kind of anxiety. It is a wonderful thing to find a place where we can talk about these things that some people would stare at you like you are plum crazy for. Thank you for being so kind and letting me express myself.",

Thats because it helps your digestive system when you lay on the left side. The burning tingling sensation in the mouth and throat. acid reflux. the lump in the throat that feels like you cant swallow or hawk it up. acid reflux. chest pains and arm pains.irratation of the esophagas.palpatations and dizziness. irratation of the Vegas/Sinus Nerve. stomach in knots and etc. It all sounds like Gerd. Oh,\u00a0\u00a0the soldier that took Nexium for it and finally found away to beat anxiety. If you didn't catch that earlier in this discussion. That is exactly what i am trying to get across. Some of you may be experiencing Gerd or stomach issues and it has not been identified as the culprit to your anxiety. If that isn't jumping out at you right about now then it probably doesn't apply to you.",

This just made it worse. After 2 bad years it steadily got better, a wee bit if relaxation, meditation, exercise and...time. I still feel anxious and down at times but I'm not sure it's any worse than feelings I had before the anxiety appeared. I take a drink (as we say in Scotland) but try to keep it light, enjoy an esspresso in the morning and have generally list that horrible fear that my quality if life has gone for good- that was the worst thing. Taking your anxiety on helps some. Heart racing? Go for a run 'I'll show you racing!'; think you're dying? 'Come and get me- I'm ready!'

Distraction and Diversion is the key. I have faced all my anxieties.Ive flew on planes on my owns numberous of times since last october and i felt so horrible,but it soon passes.All of us have anxiety,everyone on this planet!its just some people's levels go to high.and we need a way in which we can bring it back down..being more anxious about the symptoms is not the right way.1. Anxiety is a learned behaviour (Habit)- our subconscious mind stores all the negative and brings it to the conscious mind.2.A 'limited symptom attack 'is person who has 4 or less symptoms..this usually means they are recovering.3.Find your 'holy grail' a hobby that you can involve in to make yourself better and be your key diversion.4. Anxiety is not an Illness....its a learnt behaviour...therefor it needs no cure!!...you must try bury the anxiety as much as possible.I hope you all recover,there is hope.you just have to be patient and positive.firstly ive read anti-anxiety medication only works for some people...and its to do with our mind which manifests this physical symptoms....if your taking medication for a learnt behaviour...then you should come off those...and unlearn the behaviour yourself.Things do get easier,dont learn to just 'manage' replace the anxious habit with the new Non-anxious.If anyone has any questions feel free to write back.Good luck and bless all of you.",

            "answer": "Hey guys,Just thought I'd add the SAME story to the hundreds already posted on this forum! I've been having chest and arm pains (I don't need to describe them, same as ALL the other posts) for the past couple of years now, got the checkups (I don't need to say which ones, same as ALL the other posts) and things turned out fine (same as ALL the other posts.)So here's my deal tonight. I started having strange sensations in my left arm again tonight, right now in fact. I was sitting on my ocuch about half an hour ago and as soon as I started feeling these sensations, YOU KNOW them, my mind began to hone in on them:\"Why the hell is my arm hurting? Why my left arm? Can I really just ignore it? Maybe my body is trying to tell me something. Maybe its telling me that somehting is wrong. Why would my body hurt for no reason? Something must be wrong.\"Now I'm good and focused, at this point I'm practically waiting for a stiff breeze to blow across my left arm and notice what the sensation feels like. I know that left arm pain is linked to heart attack, and now I'm waiting, literally just waiting for any slight discomfort, any slight abnormality, and bingo---thats a trigger----this is it, say goodbye. I have pulsating, radiating discomfort through my left arm, and now I feel something changing in my chest, it can be nothing BUT a heart attack.Yes------- this is the same story all over again. This is my story---itsyour story too, I know it is, because I've seen it SO many times. Don't think this is the first time I have come to this site looking for a little psychological comfort. I know that I have anxiety, because I have been diagnosed with it. So do you. I know that I don't have a heart problem, because I've been thoughly examined by professionals who train for years upon years in order to know the human body and how it works BETTER THAN ME.Yet I end up thinking that I am going to have a heart attack anyway....thats absolutely insane.So heres my approach:In a sense I'm giving up. I'm giving up on the idea that this pain, this shortness of breath, this uneasiness has anything to do with my heart. I'm giving up because I'm tired of toying with the idea, and I'm tired of being afraid, because IT DOESNT MAKE ANY DAMN SENSE.I am NOT giving up on the pain, however. The pain that my anxiety produces on a regular basis is not \"just in my head\". It can't be because I feel it, and it hurts, and its discomforting, but this pain will not kill me.My anxiety-ridden brain says, \"Oh yeah?\"I say \"Fine, let it kill me then, because what else can I do?\" I have been tested for heart problems, and I am a healthy 24 year old man. I STILL have a sensation in my left arm, and right now I am literally just trying to LET it hurt, and if later I feel as though I can't breathe, then -----I will just let myself feel like I can't breathe because that's what my body is doing at that moment.And later tonight, when I just let all of that pain take its course and I finally have that heart attack, I'll say \"Thank God\", because apparently I've been waiting for it to come along for two damn years now. And when I see whatever God there is in heaven he'll say \"what were you so scared for? Don't you know that there are plenty of other ways to die? Didn't you realize that it doesn't matter when or where or how it happens because it's going to happen anyway? Could you not somehow find a way to live instead of WAIT to die?I guess my point it, I feel like I can't beat this anxiety. I'm going to join it. I've done my part, AND YOU HAVE DONE YOUR PART to take necessary measures in light of given situations. I feel strange pains in my body, strange pains that are DIRECTLY related to critical symptoms of heart disease and heart attack, yet any test performed\u00a0\u00a0in this age of technology has revealed NOTHING that suggests that I am in any immediate danger of heart failure, and neither are you.This post has been for me, and I've tried to make it for you too, and hopefully we can move on with this affliction. Don't try to beat it, try to bear it, and then maybe we can move past it.Take courage, know that pain is pain, and thats all it is.",

Please google costochondritis as it added up with me then my doc confirmed it by examining my ribs, but I still don't know what this lump is on the bottom of my breastbone, they say it's inflamed cartilage but being an anxious person I fear the big C!

            "answer": "From what I'm reading above, could you be suffering from costochondritis/tietze syndrome, here are the signs/symptomsThe primary presentation of the syndrome is significant, acute pain in the chest, along with tenderness and some swelling of the cartilages affected, which is commonly palpable on examination. Although many times it can be extremely painful, to the point of being debilitating, Tietze's Syndrome is considered to be a benign condition that generally resolves in 12 weeks. However, it can often be a chronic condition. The pain can be identical to a heart attack and can cause hyper ventilating, anxiety attacks, passing out, panic attacks and temporary numbness/paralysis.Many cases of heart attack victims have been re-considered and improperly diagnosed, due to the identical nature of the symptoms.Perceived pain is often exacerbated with respiration.Costochondritis symptoms are similar to Tietze's, the prime difference being that the pain radiates to the arms and shoulders in the latter.My doc diagnosed me with this this week, my symptoms mimic those of a heart attack, pain in chest, left arm, shoulder, pins and needles, feeling sick etc and I get massive panic attacks that I nearly pass out! I'm not saying you definitely have it, but maybe worth checking out? It's not a serious condition but can be debilitating?",

            "answer": "Reading all these responses really helped me calm down and further reassure myself that I am not alone. I suffer from panic attacks that started when I was 15. I was diagnosed with panic disorder and was able to stablize with Paxil. Although I often would have small attacks here and there I was able to control them with breathing techniques and calling my mother who is an RN. I have moved, had a baby, live with my amazing boyfriend of three years and have managed quite nicely until just recently (i'm 26 by the way) when I had a really bad attack on Thanksgiving. All because I had the worst tummy ache and diarrhea. My whole body felt hot and I was in an instant panic over the symptoms my body was experiencing from the stomach ache. I was about to make my BF take me to the hospital, but I was able to calm down enough and relax my mind. Well I had another attack on the 6th of December and this time it was REALLY bad. I ate Pizza Hut (THE DEVIL FOOD) and it gave me the worst tummy ache. I started to panic and this spiraled out of control for two days. I could barely sleep, eat, function. I couldn't drive, which was a new symptom for me..Finally I had my mom come and take me to urgent care where they gave me lorazepam for the anxiety. Now I HATE taking pills but they actually work and help me just...exhale. relax. I have been struggling still with the idea of having to take a pill to calm myself but I am planning on using it just to get me back on track. I also am going to cognitive therapy and joining a support group so I can really manage this and keep it in control. That is the MAIN thing here. I CONTROL THIS. IT DOESN'T CONTROL ME. I have trained my brain to INSTANTLY think there is something wrong and there ISN'T. I am learning every SECOND to just let my body do its thing. its made to panic. and fighting it is just going to make it 1,000 times worse. I have been diagnosed a healthy 26 yr old female, havent had any tests done on my heart because I KNOW there is nothing wrong. Yet my brain is like UH YES THERE IS. WELL YOU KNOW WHAT? **** YOU BRAIN. I am 100% committed to live my life to the fullest and not let this define who I am. I have made it this far living with this panic disorder and I will be DAMNED if I let it stop me now.",

Our everyday life & worrying about our children, health, $ and just everything will lead to anxiety/panic attacks, they work together. I had my heart checked out 3 times, went to the e.r about 4 times, was given ant acid for my gas(which comes from anxiety as well) I went through so many test and I worried more and more and the anxiety worsen. Personally I take my moms meds when I am tired of feeling faint, irrible, scared AND most of all worried. My doctor won't prescibe me with anything.I sure if you read your religous book or Bible you can fight it. Because its all in the mind. Take Care~ Kish",

            "answer": "Hi Guys. I thank God for leading me to this forum. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder about a month ago. In just one month I have had almost all physical symptoms of Anxiety Sufferer. Chest pains, shortness of breath, sweating, lightheadedness, pins and needles, palpitations, pains on my arms and shoulders (mostly on left hand side), etc. Believe it or not, I\u2019ve had all these symptoms and more. I\u2019ve had three Panic Attack all in different forms, thought I was gonna die each time they happened. I\u2019ve done CT scan, MRI, ECG, blood/urine tests, heart sonar, nerve tests and others that I don\u2019t even know what they are called. All these tests came out with normal results. All the symptoms have gone away except palpitations and chest pains.Though I\u2019ve had all these symptoms, they did not come all at once. One symptom would come and once I have been able to convince my mind that its all in my head, the symptom would stop and a new symptom would follow. That\u2019s anxiety is! Once u manage to deal with one symptom, its presents itself in another form.I must say, this past month with this thing was probably thus far the worst time in my life. But at the same time these experience is changing my life to be a better person. You see I have been living with fear and worries for a better part of my life. Had these fears never presented themselves in this way (Attacks and other symptoms), I was gonna live with them for the rest of my life without ever confronting them. I with these attacks and other symptoms, It\u2019s a way of God to make me confront my fears and worries in to be a better person.I urge everyone on this forum to take this experience as a blessing in blessing in disguise. Fact is, if you suffer from anxiety it means you have constant negative thoughts and negative thoughts disrupt life. Take you condition as an opportunity for you to confront these negative thoughts and eliminate them for Good. I know this is easier said than done, but IT CAN BE DONE!!\u00a0\u00a0In my case, have requested a divine intervention from God. I have revisited the basis of my faith and brought closer to God. People who have true faith in God never fear or worry. You always know that God got you!The next step is for us to be in control of what our minds absorbs and choose deviate from the negative. Our minds feed our subconscious and anxiety emanates the subconscious (most times). STOP thinking the worst of every situation (I know it\u2019s not easy, BUT IT CAN BE DONE)!!!. BE FREE!!!\u00a0\u00a0Reprogram your way of thinking.\u00a0\u00a0Leave no place in your mind for negative thoughts!! Read positive books/articles, mix with positive people, find interesting hobbies.Make an informed decision that YOU WILL STAY POSITIVE whether attacks/other symptoms come or not. Have a phrase of reaffirmation that you always say when these attacks come.\u00a0\u00a0One of my phrases is\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMy Redeemer lives!!\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0Take mine or make you own, don\u2019t just say them, believe in these phrases. You will be amazed that change that your way of thinking will bring into your life!!!!Jesus Bless you all!!!!!!",

            "answer": "Great Forum!I have found it really helpful reading through these posts as it does seem we are all sharing the similar/same symptoms. I am a 30 year old man, non smoker for 16 months , no drugs.My first experience with this was a year ago, but last week it has come back again. Basically I woke up at 3am suddenly, my heart immediately starting racing, I started sweating and could not stop. I had to get out of the covers to calm and cool myself down. (a classic panic attack I am told)Since then I have a dull ache in my left chest, which sometimes moves to my back or left shoulder and arm, I also have the odd sharp pain and iregular heartbeat from time to time. I was wondering if anyone else walkes up in the middle of the night with these pains? of course, I wake up, worry and cant sleep properly.I have been to the Doctor who thinks it is Anxiety once more, heart sounds fine, lungs seem fine, oxygen levels are fine and ECG seems fine. (had a chest x-ray last year, fine)This saturday, I still had the pains and felt bad so my family took me to the walk in clinic who immediatley hooked my up to an ECG and started panicking because my heartbeat was irregular and my blood pressure shot up...yet my ECG was fine. I got reffered to an out of hours\u00a0\u00a0hospital GP who said I was ok, and has reffered me to have a heart stress test to rule out every possibility. I am assuming (hoping) that the experience of being hooked up like that in the walk in clinic caused my anxiety levels to rise and affect my BP and heart rythymn.Of course since then, I have tried to remain positive. Like we all should. Sure enough, taking your mind of it for a while does make the feelings and pains go away...until you notice you dont have the pains any more and they come back.A horrible loop to be stuck in and I fully appreciate how everyone is feeling.I have been applying for numerous jobs and trying to progess my career over the last two months or so, I've had many interviews and I have always been 'the runner up'. whilst I have have had good feedback from the interviews I keep telling myself that this is my bodies way of dealing with the ups and downs.Chin up folks, we will get through this",

            "answer": "I suffer from anxiety.Last September, I went to two doctors because I had a pain in the right side of my chest. The doctors could not figure out what was wrong with me, but I remained convinced that it was a case of appendicitis \u2013 even though the only symptom I experienced was a pain. No vomiting or any of the other symptoms.Finally, one day I went to the ER. They ran blood work and did a CT scan, and they found nothing. They gave me some pills for acid reflux, which I began to take. I also began to eat a lot healthier. Eventually it went away.Then, in October, I was sitting on the couch one night, when I felt a cold sensation in my chest. I felt like there was a leak in my chest, and it was leaking a cold fluid. This worried me a lot. This sensation made me more aware of my heartbeat, which I thought was too fast. I believed I was having heart palpitations so again I went to the ER. At the ER they ran an EKG and some chest x-rays. Everything was normal. The doctor told me I looked anxious, and that I shouldn\u2019t be because I had nothing to worry about.After the second visit to the ER, I followed up with a new doctor. This doctor performed a physical and blood work and said I looked healthy. He said I just needed to exercise regularly because I don\u2019t.I even saw an Asian herbalist doctor. He gave me herbs that promote better circulation, but also said just from looking at me that I worry too much.November went on with a lot of odd pressures or odd feelings in my chest.December was the same. During the holiday season, I had an irrational fear that something bad would happen on my birthday (December 24th or Christmas). Nothing of the sort happened. On the 24th, during my church\u2019s Christmas Eve service, I felt some more heart palpitations and began to panic. However, as soon as it was over, I was fine.Also during December and for months after, I felt that I needed to have my hand over my chest to prevent something from happening.Around late December, I began experiencing some chest tightness. I visited the doctor and he performed an EKG. Everything was fine.In January, I started at a new school. I began attending a four-year institution, which was more stressful than the community college I was attending. Chest pain and discomfort seemed to go away during January and through March. I feel that the new stress from school was a good thing, because it gave me something to focus on. Other than continue worrying about my health.Again recently, after coming home from a very stressful week of both work and school, I came home and felt a sharp pain in the right side of the chest. I had experienced this type of pain before, but it lasted for around one-hour and 45-minutes. I was freaking out, so I called my doctor on his cell phone. He asked me several questions, and decided that I just needed to take some Advil and that there was no need to go to the ER. I felt fine almost immediately after getting off the phone with him.But in the days after, the chest pain and discomfort continued. One night, I had started to feel a pain in my arms, reading that pain in the arm is associated with heart attacks I panicked. That night I went to the ER again. At the ER the performed some blood tests and x-rays. Again, they found nothing wrong.I\u2019ve had other with feelings, such as tingling in my body, random spasms, even a cold sensation in my forehead. But I\u2019ve decided this is all stress. After so many doctors that have studied for years and had years of experience, none of them have found anything wrong with me.Why am I worrying? I don\u2019t know. But I need to stop. I want to cast my anxieties away. I want to declare myself free from these fears. These pains and weird sensations are all because of my anxiety. I want to stop. No more anxiety, no more fear. I want to be free.It all started when I overanalyzed and concluded the worst possible situation over some stomach pain. I declare no more. I declare freedom.",

The symtoms I had which took me to the ER were rapid heart beat and felling of passing out.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't have chest pain when I went to ER this chest pain came a week after ER visit.I have had the following test done: 4 chest X-ray, 1 chest cat scan (with dye), 2 echo, 3 EKG, 1 stress test, 1 endoscopy, ultrasound of liver, pancreas and gallbladder, thyroid, 1 mammogram,\u00a0\u00a03 complete blood work and 2 urine test. All came back negative and well. I was also tested for mono virus (negative also) because in between my panic attack (visit to ER) and the chest pain (a week after ER)\u00a0\u00a0I had kind of bad cold with a lot of cough.I'm being sent to a Rheumatologist this week for some other tests.\u00a0\u00a0I have been diagnosed with supposed pleurisy (because of the bad cold / cough I had 2 months ago) and or perhaps some anxiety or stress. I don't know what to think anymore.\u00a0\u00a0One minute I think I might be dying or have something they haven't discover yet.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I think the constant pain in the chest could be pleurisy like the doctor think it could be or that it could be coming from my back or something with nerve disfuntion due to past car accidents (I never experienced chest pain then or never in my life until this past 3 months). I do have anxiety due to all this constant pain on my left side that doesn't go away but I'm confused because I don't know if this pain is real or is just my mind. I feel pain all over my chest muscle or rib from time to time but the main pain that is always constant for the past 3 months I only feel when I take a deep breath I feel it like a sharp pain but only on the left side.\u00a0\u00a0Someone has the same? Can someone be so kind to tell me what they think?....sorry for misspellings english is not my first language.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much!",

            "answer": "This message board has helped me today. Just like every other day I have some weird symptom that makes me feel like I'm dying. This week it has been left arm pain. But last week it was feeling confused and foggy. The month before it was chest pain and palpitations. A few months before that it's tight chest and shortness of breath. Sometimes is hot/cold flashes and clammy fingers and tingly toes and dry mouth. It's like my anxiety is always trying to out-smart me. As soon as I get used to a symptom or get it checked and know it's not fatal, my body moves on. I'm in constant fear and confusion because how will I ever know if a symptom is serious or just the new manifestation of anxiety? I hate fighting my way through every day telling myself I'm going to be okay, telling myself I'm going to live. I think the longer this goes on perhaps the more strength I'll have to fight it because I can count the days I've won before. Lately reading the Bible has helped and if you are fearing death, perhaps having faith in the afterlife and strength from God is the best of comfort. We all need to read these posts and remind ourselves that these symptoms aren't just ours, they are common and we all suffer but knowing we aren't alone can help us fight back against our symptoms.",

Its there when i'm calm and in a good mood and its there when i'm stressing about it. I've been to the emergency 3 times and got a ecg done and it was fine.

I work out of town and every time i go i get scared because i'm thinking this could be the time i have the heart attack..

In my opinion a dependency is better than anxiety. Maybe you'll agree. Antidepressants can help but take a while to kick in. Steer clear of Effexor because you cannot miss a dose or stop taking it. The withdrawal symptoms are hell. Lexapro or Zoloft are good choices. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has been proven to help. There are web sites that allow you to do that on-line for free.",

I am now 30 years of age and it has manifested itself much like you all are describing.I, too have found that the more distracted I am (exercise, work, socializing, etc) the less I feel the symptoms both physically and emotionally.I also have had reassurance from physicians after ekg's, blood pressure/pulse monitoring, and blood tests that there is nothing physically wrong with me and I am in ideal health. They even chuckle when I tell them I run 3-5 miles per day/5-6 days per week as if it were a serious physical condition I would A) not be able to handle even half of that exercise and B) I wouldn't feel relief both during and after.It's tough to live with the fear, but I have researched some CBT, meditation, and even some religious therapies and exercises which all help a little bit at a time. Medication has also never been much of a help to me and I have been in trying, anxiety-filled times in the past where it always has passed as long as I didn't let it completely control my life.This time around is a bit more confusing however, having the symptoms more so physically than emotionally, but as we all can see, this thread is helpful on it's own as it has stood the test of time!Just wanted to show my appreciation for it.",

Well I've come to realize that anxiety is like bullying, it teases you and frightens us, but that will end if we start fighting it and no let it take over our lives. We only live once and this is not the way to live.We need to relax and stop worring. Remember when you used to not have anxiety and our heart would beat fast after exercising, and you wouldn't get scared?\u00a0\u00a0But since the first attack we have been fearing the nextand the next. And we give it to much important and that why it does what it does. Lets relax and fight it, talk to it tell it I feel you and that's fine but you don't scare me anymore. Keep practicing until that day that it knows you don't follow the game then it will leave.Something that really helped me is changing your lifestyle a little like don't drink as much exercise a little like run.and try not to stress, nothing in this world is worth more than our health.",

He asked me if I get nervous and anxious at dentist and orthodontist and I said yes I do. I've had braces before, I know this sounds crazy, but I'll be glad to get braces back on. I'm like a bag of nerves and on edge, feels like I'm going crazy. My doctor also told me if I got my jaw fixed, it could fix my ears, so I'm staying hopeful for that, hopefully it could fix the anxiety and on top of all that I have dizziness, so it could fix everything. I'm trying to stay positive, but its really hard. I also get chest pains and don't like them at all, my arm hurts every now and then. I probably had this before and didn't even notice anything. I went to the website anxiety centre and read all the symptoms it said on there and I have it. I clench and grind my teeth without me knowing and after that happens, it hurts and I cry.

Flared up when my grandpa had a heart attack, then again when my sister died of preeclampsia, then again when my mom died of a heart attack. The last year I was on Lexapro and did wonderful. but I quit taking it because I wanted to see if it was gone, and if not I wanted to try to cope with it on my own and see if I can get passed it. Well....I've been off the meds for about 4 months now and the symptoms have come back: chest pain, arm pain, constant shoulder and upper back pain, nervous stomach, panic attacks, feeling like I'm going to die, constantly researching heart issues and anxiety because i'm convinced im going to have a heart attack. What scares me the most is the week before my mom's heart attack she thought she had anxiety, she described her symptoms to me and asked if that's how my anxiety felt and it was exactly the same. The morning of her heart attack she asked for a klonopin that i had because she was feeling very \"anxious\".... two hours later she has a heart attack and dies. Now I CANT stop obsessing about it and worrying that I'll just think I have anxiety and end up having\u00a0\u00a0a heart attack too. I have been to the ER 3 times thinking that I'm dying and had EKGs that have fine, along with chest xrays. But I still don't feel peace of mind, and this anxiety is literally taking over and ruining my life....",

            "answer": ". I am describing my problem here. Please help me in this context. Please suggest me. I wiil follow Your suggestions. Please reply for this message.I am a having anxiety problem (based on my symptoms i concluded) from past two years. Continuously I am having chest pain and the pain is transferring back side of left shoulder to front side of chest. My left finger nerve is shaking also paining. I met five doctors who are general medicine and one neurologist, ENT and Psychiatrist. I have taken test like ECG and chest X-ray, Blood test and thyroid test. Everything showed normal. It\u2019s taken me one year to recognize it is due to anxiety. Doctor suggested me clonazepam 0.25mg for two months, after taking that tablet I feel 80% reduction in my pain. The dosage was increased to 0.5mg and used for two months. Almost my problem disappears and at that time I stopped taking tablets. For three months everything is ok and after that the problem come again and again. Whenever I am taking clonazepam I feel ok and if I am not taking I can\u2019t able to bear the nerve pain, chest pain and uneasy and confusion. Sometimes I am frustrated and feeling hopeless. Even exercise also not giving any relax to me.Sometimes I am feeling something happen to my heart, I will get heart attack and so many negative thoughts. I am unable to concentrate on my studies. Even I can\u2019t able to enjoy fully, things like parties, watching movies and chat with friends. I am always having fear of chest pain and anxiety. I am always keeping clonazepam in my pocket. That much bad situation I am facing. My friends are suggesting me to go to yoga and try for acupuncture. But I am feeling nothing will cure my problem. I am avoiding lonely traveling and going far places where there is no availability of doctor. I know all this things are nonsense. Sometimes I will feel like I am brave person and I can overcome all this things. Whenever fear comes I am becoming over anxious. This problem was severe at staring but now I started reading so many articles on this and got some confidence. But help me to fully and completely getting out of this and continue my routine life without taking clonazepam. Fully irritated and frustrated with this problem. Its completely taken away my life from the past two years. Plzzzzzzzzzzzz suggest me.I am expecting a solution because I met all doctors all are saying it is due to your thinking and you don\u2019t have any health problem. Always they are prescribing clonazepam. Suggest me some Ayurveda medicines which will cure my symptoms",

    "question": "I'm 34 yr old male and have been experiencing various chest and left arm pains for about three months.\u00a0\u00a0I've seen a plethora of doctors from cardiologist to internist to GI doc to psychologist.\u00a0\u00a0Heart problems have been ruled out by numerous EKG's and stress echo test.\u00a0\u00a0GI doc found I have a hiatal hernia/GERD from upper GI and is currently being treated with Nexium.\u00a0\u00a0Have also had ultrasound of liver/gall bladder and MRI of abdomen - all normal.\u00a0\u00a0Feel like a pin cushion from all the blood work - again all within normal ranges.My psychologist insists anxiety is the culprit.\u00a0\u00a0Though I have been under a fair amount of stress with work and family, can these pains linger around for this long just from anxiety?\u00a0\u00a0They come and go throughout the day and are very disruptive to my thinking of 'what's going on with me? - which I'm guessing only breeds more anxiety.The only other med I'm on is Lipitor for cholestorol.I'm reluctant to try any anti-anxiety meds since I had a bad bout with cymbalta a few months back and I really don't feel as though I need it.\u00a0\u00a0I just want the pain to stop.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried numerous relaxation and meditation methods which are very calming and helpful, but still the pain comes.\u00a0\u00a0The only time I don't notice it is when I'm exercising (usually run 3-6 miles/day).Any thoughts of what's going on?\u00a0\u00a0Anxiety, current med side effects or something else?",
