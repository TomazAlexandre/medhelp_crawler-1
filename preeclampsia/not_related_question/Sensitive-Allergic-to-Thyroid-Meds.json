            "answer": "No, there isn't anything you take as a substitute for thyroid med.\u00a0\u00a0Many \"side effects\" of the med are actually those of hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0Being hypo can cause some of the symptoms of RA, such as the joint/muscle aches, etc.Some people do react to fillers/binders/dyes in the levo.\u00a0\u00a0Have you tried a different manufacturer?\u00a0\u00a0Each manufacturer uses different fillers/binders, so you might find one that doesn't have those effects.All of that said, what are your actual thyroid hormone levels?\u00a0\u00a0You should be tested regularly for Free T3, Free T4 and TSH.\u00a0\u00a0Please post your actual levels and be sure to include reference ranges, which vary lab to lab and have to come from your own report.",

            "answer": "thanks barb but I've tried them all from UK to Australia.\u00a0\u00a0tried thyroid extract to synthetic t4 and synthetic t3.when I first started taking this stuff years ago I just thought my hypoT symptoms were getting worse and the t4 wasn't doing it for me, so I took more.\u00a0\u00a0well not long after my teeth were super sensitive, and one tooth almost died, my skin felt like it had sunburn when any pressure applied to it... so sliding across the car seat was agony.\u00a0\u00a0I doubt it the fillers.\u00a0\u00a0I am pretty sure it is the active ingredient.\u00a0\u00a0seems I have to be hypoT for rest of my life as in the end it affected my joints.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure as now when I take any, I have a joint flare within hours.\u00a0\u00a0also have head issues on taking it... feeling loads of head pressure.",

            "answer": "The synthetic levothyroxine in the pills is identical to that which your body would make if it could, and levothyroxine, itself, doesn't work fast enough for you to have a reaction within hours, unless you're reacting to fillers/binders/dyes.\u00a0\u00a0The T4 in your system today is from that you took, at least, a couple weeks or more ago.The active ingredients in synthetic T3 and T4 are very different from each other and it's high unlikely, to nearly impossible for you to be allergic to both active ingredients.I'm assuming that \"thyroid extract\" is desiccated hormone containing both T4 and T3?\u00a0\u00a0If so, that's made from pig thyroid and is not the same as human thyroid hormones, though some people do much better on it than they do on synthetics. Again, the T4 doesn't work fast enough for you have a reaction within hours of taking it.If you'll post your current thyroid hormone levels, maybe we can help shed some light on the situation.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to include reference ranges with any labs, as ranges vary lab to lab and have to come from your own report.In addition, do you know if you have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis?",

            "answer": "My doctor recently told me I have hashimotos, but I dont have a lot if the symptons, I am actually quite opposite in some instances, and was wondering if you could help me understand. The only copy if results that I have is thyroid peroxidase (tpo) ab result 47 flag high units iu/ml 0-34\u00a0\u00a0 I have had 7 very healthy babies, im 200 pounds, had preeclampsia with my last and blood pressure elevated, its back down to 126/86 now, but he said the reasonit got high was the hashimotos, but im never tired, in fact im overly anxious and hyper, it is hard for me to lose weight tho, he did and ultra sound but all he said was it was slightly inflamed. Also he prescribed me armour thyroid, and calcium with iodine which I am confused about because everything I have read suggests I have to much iodine.",

    "question": "For years now I have had side effects to thyroid meds but didn't realise it was the meds causing the problems.\u00a0\u00a0They became severe in 2010 and I was dxd with rheumatoid arthritis but have since figured out that it is BOTH t4 and T3 that causes the problem.\u00a0\u00a0It also causes me to have burning skin.\u00a0\u00a0These symptoms are so severe I cannot take even small amounts of T4 or T3.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried all forms - synthetic and nth - together and separate.\u00a0\u00a0All have this effect on me.\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything I can do or take as a substitute for thyroid meds?",
