I know that it could still be a while... But since then I have lost my plug... I have had really strong pressure, and really strong but not patterned contractions... A Watery discharge every so often, and her movement as slowed a bit. My hubby checked me lastnight and said that he felt her head about 1 1/2 inches in... He said that it just felt like a really thin tissue between her head and his fingers. He could not find the whole in cervix to try and check dilation so I do not know on that. I called doc lastnight about the discharge and he said it was completely normal and that I will probably go in the next week. What do you all think?",
