            "answer": "I have endometriosis. I did not have a problem getting pregnant, but staying pregnant. I've had 4 miscarriages aND my husband and I were just devastated. One required a D&C but luckily the others just naturally progressed. The last MC was the week of Christmas on the car ride to my families home (a 16 hour drive). I didn't even want to try anymore after that. My husband decided to make dinner one night and I swore he gave me food poisoning. He suggested I take a test (he knew it wasn't the food). It came back positive and I've been terrified. But now I'm in my 11th week. And my doctor said the chance of me losing my little nugget are very slim. I've had 3 ultrasounds and everything looks great. This is the farthest I've ever made it and this really is my little miracle!",

            "answer": "For years I wanted a baby, and I was stoked when my ex husband and I finally started trying. Fast forward three months later, and he blindsides me with the old \"I never love you and I'm not sure why I married you, you have three days to get out of my house.\"After that, I went through a flavor of the month phase for a while when it came to men. I became pregnant unexpectedly, but had a misscariage at 10 weeks. I then had a whole host of health issues crop up, the chief of which was being diagnosed borderline diabetic.Between the lack of stable home life, health issues, and no reliable partner, I sort of gave up on my dream of motherhood at that point, and decided I'd just focus on me. It took me about five years to straighten my life out. I dropped a ton of weight, got my health more under control, and met a really great guy. He's not rich, but he treats me like absolute gold. I was genuinely happy, even if it was just him and I. Kids weren't even a blip on the radar anymore, and that was okay.we were using condoms, but, we have a weird habit of having sex in our sleep without either one of us waking up,\u00a0\u00a0and of course that led to our little surprise pregnancy. I'm 18 weeks now, and I'm so happy that the dream I had forced myself to give up has come true, without my even planning on it. Life has a funny way of working out after it craps all over you, I guess.",

            "answer": "When my hubby and I decided it was time to try I got pregnant that night. 9 weeks in I miscarried. I was devestated and knee I wanted to try again. As soon as we got the green light to try I got pregnant again in 1 night. Our Rainbow was born 42 weeks later. Flash forward 18 months we were now into our 30's and decided to try for another. We figured it wouldn't take any time because of how easy it was to become pregnant the last two times. I went off my nuva ring and my cycle was like clock work. We tried and tried and nothing.\u00a0\u00a0After a year and a half I resolved myself to thinking that maybe I was just meant to have one, who was 3 now. At the end of august I started testing before my missed period and kept getting negative results but something felt off. A week after my missed period I finally tested positive! I couldn't understand why it took that long and was certain I would miscarry just like the first time. Went in for an ultrasound at what we thought was 13 weeks because doctor couldn't hear a heartbeat on the doppler. Ultrasound showed our little man but he measured a week earlier than my lmp estimate. Turns out after I had my daughter and went on my birth control my body even though was still regular as clockwork was ovulating a week later than it used to. We had literally been having sex a week too early every month for a year and a half. Even though this baby was wanted and planned for he is literally our oops baby after a night out lol if we hadn't had date night he wouldn't exist.",

    "question": "Here is ours:My husband and i thought for the longest i couldnt have kids. So we never took precautions. In September i found out i was 5 weeks pregnant. A couple weeks later, i started to bleed and my hormone levels were super low.. they then put me on bed rest and told me not to expect my pregnancy to continue. My husband and i were devestated. Bc we too thought this was my last chance. Like what if i never get pregnant again? But after a month and a half on bed rest, lots of extra hormone pills plus prenatal vitamins, here i am today with 11 days to go until ny due date. We definitely consider our son our miracle baby. Bc we were told so many times we wouldnt ever get to meet him... and we are beyond blessed and thankful that we will be holding our son for the first time in a few more days or so.",
