            "answer": "Well lets see.....Christmas was fun but hectic we were back and forth between my fams and my in laws house. This week is all about getting ready for the baby shower on 1/18. Logan's room was painted yesterday and his border is going up in the next day or so. We have finished clearing out his room except for his things (wardrobe, changing table so far). For New Years i am going to a get together at my moms which should be fun.Moving around is definitely getting harder. I find myself getting stuck sittin/laying often. Sleep is still brutal between having to be every 2 hrs and not being able to stay comfortable its tough. So far no swelling. But having some numbness in my hands during bed time. Sciatica had begun to act up in my right leg which makes my movements even worse....My next Dr appt is tomorrow morning. I plan on finding out if Logan is working his way into position. Plus i am curious if they can guesstimate his weight. Only 6ish weeks left for me so far.Hope everyone is doing well.Happy New Year",

            "answer": "Hmmmm....lots of dramas for me in the past week.I'm currently in Hong Kong, staying with my colleague and his family (wife, 3 kids and father).\u00a0\u00a0One can still travel up to 36 weeks and I guess I'm making the most of it.I went with them to China and we did a 4 day, 3 night package tour to Xian, just back on Monday late.\u00a0\u00a0It was very interesting and very hectic and I got to do lots of walking. Saw the terracotta warriors, many temples, famous writings, among others...... got heaps of photos and I'll try to post a few in a while.....It was also freezing cold, but no snow.\u00a0\u00a0My first time to experience such cold weather.\u00a0\u00a0The hardest thing was that my **** went rock hard from the cold and were exquisitely painful in a way I have never experienced before!\u00a0\u00a0Hope breast feeding aint going to feel anything like that when I first start.I'm on insulin.\u00a0\u00a0On the last day, I took my insulin, finished packing and headed down for breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0I never made it to the breakfast area.\u00a0\u00a0I collapsed in the lobby.\u00a0\u00a0I was still talking, but have no recollection of the next hour or so.\u00a0\u00a0My colleague was called and told them my history.\u00a0\u00a0They tried to test my blood sugar and it was not detectable on their instrument.... so they were giving me sugar water and candy.\u00a0\u00a0My colleague says I was talking to them and disagreeing with their instructions, but I have no memory of that.\u00a0\u00a0The hotel called an ambulance and I was taken to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0I 'woke up' at the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0They did ultrasound to check the baby, urinalysis and a few other tests. All in Chinese (I understand a bit of chinese, but my colleague was also translating for me).\u00a0\u00a0 All tests were ok, except the urinalysis which showed protein (+1) and keytones (first time to see protein, and I test every few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0And first time to test for keytones).So I'll have to follow up on that when I get back to Manila in a couple of days (I sent a message to my endocrinologist, but guess he's on holiday and no response so far) - due to head back on Saturday.\u00a0\u00a0My BP is rising compared to normal (previously it was very low), but is still within normal range....\u00a0\u00a0 so I reckon they're going to be monitoring me for preeclampsia very closely now.I'm packed for the hospital...... already..... in case.....Having back pain the past 2 days, worse today.\u00a0\u00a0Baby's moving a lot too.\u00a0\u00a0Not at all helped by my having a nasty cold and asthma at the moment, and the meds aren't working so well.\u00a0\u00a0My tummy is sore from coughing.This Friday I'll be 35 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Baby's got to hang on another 2 weeks up to 37 weeks, at least.\u00a0\u00a0My next Drs apt is on 5th.\u00a0\u00a0We'll also be doing ultrasound to check baby's position, size, and all.\u00a0\u00a0So I'll also have an update for the next post.Best wishes to all.\u00a0\u00a0Not so long for us now.Happy New Year everyone.",

It is comforting to know I'm so close to delivering...I haven't been feeling that bad but some days and nights are tough. And most of all, I spend so much time in Caidens room, just going through his clothes and it just makes me want him here that much more! But I am like you..especially now that were in a new home, I try and keep everything perfect and clean! I'm not sure if its extra anal because I'm Pregnant but I am always cleaning or organizing something.I'm not waddling yet but if I'm sitting for long periods of time and get up my hip cracks and my legs get soo stiff. But its not too long now!We had a nice New Years...had some friends over, stayed up WAY too late and only got 5 hours of sleep so I am soo tired! But it was so much fun and it was weird, when they left..I was like OMG the next time I see you all we will have a baby!! It was just so surreal. Hope everyone had a nice New Years!!",

    "question": "Wow ladies, I can't believe ANOTHER week has already passed!! So how is everyone feeling this week? Any changes? Everyone have a nice Christmas? Any plans for New Years??Right after I posted last weeks Check-In my body started to change immediately! Within this past week, sleeping has gotten more difficult for me. I think most of it had to do with the fact I had a small cold and couldn't breath too well out of my nose. BUT I was finding it very difficult to get comfortable laying down and thats never happened to me! I would just lay there and know I'm not comfortable...but couldn't pin point why! So for 2 nights in a row I slept sitting up. I told my mom that and she said when she was Pregnant with my brother, for the last month she was only comfy sleeping sitting up. But the past few nights I have been falling asleep laying down and I've been fine. So I dont know if its the way he's positioned or what. But I've been getting up to pee almost every single hour! My doctor said once his head turns down the pressure to pee will be more often and more painful...so it must be that time! Rolling over or getting up and down is funny...sometimes I need a push from hubby! LOLSitting up and watching TV for long periods of time makes me super uncomfortable too. Caiden gets in this position where it feels like he is completely spread out...and there's really no where for him to go anymore so it just feels like my stomach is in a big knot! So I have to get up and move around frequently. I shouldn't complain though, I guess this is all mild stuff..could be worse! But the more days that pass, the more ready I am to meet my little boy!Our Christmas was fun but busy! We traveled to my husbands family and than had a Holiday Party at our house to see my family and my husbands together. New Years were having a small get together with friends here so that ought to be fun!And lastly my next Doctors Appointment is Jan 5th!! So I'll have an update on next weeks check in! Hope you're all feeling great, can't wait to hear from you!!",
