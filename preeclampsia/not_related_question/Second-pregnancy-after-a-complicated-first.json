It has been very stressful but I'm getting there. Almost have my babies plus now that I'm so far along I'm not as stressed out. They have a really good chance of living if they were to come early.

            "answer": "Thank you both for your encouragement. I am just so teriffied. I was on bedrest for 3 weeks due to a slight increase in blood preassure that the doctor thought was due to me working in a childcare center. After spending three days in hospitalized bedrest i was sent home only to return the next day and was given blood preassure meds which only seemed to worsen my condition. A little less than a week later my lil one's dad found me on the floor convulsing. I was put into a coma and given a c-section. My lil one weighed 2.8 pounds and had to stay in the NICU for 5 weeks and now has cerbal palsy. Gosh sorry I ranted it just has been an emotional battle since I found out I was expecting again.",
