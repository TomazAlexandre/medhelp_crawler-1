            "answer": "Reading things like that are always scary! I had extreme head aches at first as well and I didn't take anything! I was to scared, even though Tylenol is safe during pregnancy.. I don't take anything unless I absolutely have to. But I'm not sure when it comes to codeine, especially in your first trimester. Maybe call your doc office in the am and explain your concerns, that might help. Or take normal Tylenol Sit on the edge of your tub with your feet in hot water and an ice pack on your head.. that helps. I found around the second trimester my headaches went away, it has to do with the hormone cocktail your body is going through",
