            "answer": "It could be many.things...most likely just swelling...my feet started swelling more about 2 weeks ago. I turn 31 weeks tomorrow. Doesn't help that Seattle has been having a heat wave.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed it helped if I cut back on salt a bit ans increased water. If your bp is high and you have protein in your urine as well, I would expect your doc to look into preeclampsia. I wouldnt stress. My doc is expecting me to go between 34-37 weeks.",

            "answer": "Rest with your feet elevated above your heart..circulation in your legs gets sluggish as your growing uterus puts pressure on the major blood vessels in your back. Try to sleep on your side, not your back, and keep off your feet as much as you can. I work long hours mostly standing and i have to wear compression stockings..they help with swelling and tired, heavy-feeling legs. You can get them at any pharmacy. As long as you are seeing your doc regularly i wouldn't worry much about preeclampsia..they will be checking your blood pressure and urine and they'll definitely let you know if you are at risk.",
