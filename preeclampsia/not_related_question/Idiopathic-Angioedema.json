I have been undiagnosed for the last 12 years, typically having severe swelling at least once a month.My main triggers are stress and minor trauma, I have done my best to eliminate those things from my day to day, but estrogen levels are constantly effecting my likeliness to swell.I am starting Danazol this week and am wondering if anyone else out there has any experience with this.Please, tell me anything, everything you've experienced with HAE Type III (or types I and II if you think it might help!)THANK YOU!Ayrn(also I will be attending the HAE conference in Florida in a couple weeks and would appreciate any names of doctors, people attending or good questions I should be asking.)thanks again!",

            "answer": "Hello,I know the tests I've had that have finally gotten me to a diagnosis were blood test that included my C1 and C4 levels (type I would have lower than normal C1 levels and type II your levels may be normal but the C1 molecule or whatever is mutated and doesn't work properly within your system.)I have also had tests for lupus, thyroid things and other tests that I can't remember off the top of my head but can post later when I get home and look at my lab results. Mostly these other tests were just ruling out any other condition that may cause Angioedema.The reason I got diagnosed with Type III is because my C1 and C4 levels are normal but my swelling looks and acts exactly like HAE Types I and II. Taking birth control will trigger swelling and stress is a very big trigger for me... both of these leading my doctor to believe that I have Type III (where the upregulated Factor xii is one of the reasons for swelling, as opposed to C1 levels)I hope this helps, it's what I know so far. Like I said, I am trying to figure out the most I can about Type III... since I have been called Idiopathic for 12 years and have finally just got this diagnosis.If you're diagnosed as Idiotpathic, I suggest you don't give up looking for an answer, I know how insane it can make you feel to not know why you are having swelling attacks.Hope to hear from you.thanks!Ayrn",

            "answer": "I started having regular analphlyctic type episodes (sometimes every three days or so) and after 18 rushes to the Ed and 8 ICU admissions where my face/tongue/lips/gums swelled to the point of splitting open I was taken by ambulance to a tertiary level hospital under the care of a Professor of Immunology. After yet again numerous blood tests and Ct scans looking for Lymphoma (a known cause of angioedema) I finally got a doagnosis of Idiopathic Angioedema. His immediate acute treatment was a type of speudo chemo. I took 5 antihystemines and 2 autoimmune medications 4 times a day for a month (the idea was to wipe out my receptors and shock the hypersensitivity of them) and now I take a maintainence twice daily dose of a reduced number of the same medications. So far has been 15 weeks sympton free. As much as I hate the patient sick role, It has kept me with an airway and out of ICU so I am going to continue.\u00a0\u00a0It was very interesting to hear him say that 50% of people who get this diagnosis, the condition dissapears in 2 years. I didnt get any symptons until I was 41 and our collective beleife is that my case was triggered by something happening in my body (i had lived overseas for a number of years and a few night before returning to Australia I had a bad dose of food poisioning) I then took aspirin which created that whiole salicilate binding triad thing creatying an allergy to all of those sort of medications that are known to aggrivate angioedema (aspirin, ibprofen, ace inhibitors and estrogen based meds). So I have an salicilate low diet, dont take estrogen in any form and stay away from those meds which aggrivate it and so far so good.My current concern is what antibiotics can I take in the event of needing them?",

            "answer": "Hi, welcome to the forum, C4 and C1 inhibitor antigenic levels are recommended as initial screening tests in the patient. Type I HAE involves 85% of cases; it has basically low levels of a functional C1 inhibitor. Usually the level will be less than 30 percent of normal in most patients.Type II HAE, there will be presence of a dysfunctional C1 inhibitor protein, which is present in normal or elevated amounts. Upon testing, functional levels are low as in Type I, but with normal or elevated antigenic levels.Type III HAE, the levels of C1 inhibitor will be normal but a defect in the gene for coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor) has been described. As type III is a genetic defect, it can be passed on to the offspring.Treatment options are same for all and depend on the symptoms. Treatment options available for the acute attack are C1-inhibitor [C1 esterase inhibitor replacement protein (C1INHRP)], Plasma and Antifibrinolytics against prescription.I suggest you to consult immunologist for further evaluation.

I was prescribed a combination of 3 medications to be taken all at once with the onset of swelling - Ranitidine ( 1 x 150 mg), Reactine (1 x 20 mg) and Prednisone (3 x 5 mg). This combo has worked extremely well since. I also keep an epi-pen handy as well. Hope this helps,Thanks, gerry",

My swelling generally starts with a painful itch and have had it happen so many times you just know what it is coming on.\u00a0\u00a0Although my ears have swollen in the past on occasion, I have never experienced ear bleeding, so am not sure about that.Thanks, gerry",

Just within the last year I have also been diagnosed\u00a0\u00a0with Mastocytosis, that makes my allergic reactions very severe. For both I carry 4 epi-pens, one does not give me much time. It takes 3 to get me to the ER (less than 10 miles away), were I need, by IV Benadryle, steroids and possibly Epinephrine Hang in there as time goes on, I learn my triggers, my swellings from Idiopathic Angioedema lessen in numbers. In addition to 4 Epi-pens I carry claritin reditabs, primatene mist,\u00a0\u00a0Prednisone, and Benedryl liquid caplets. I also take, daily by prescription, H1 and H2 blockers (Zantac, doxipen, Singular, Claritin x4, & Hydroxizyne), these meds have helped tremendously to keep the episodes down to only a few a year! Keep your head up, it does get better with time, patients, great doctors and great support. Explosive70",

I have suffered from idiopathic angioedema for 25 years, undertaken every allergy test and not found the cause. I have been taking 2 prescribed antihistimines Loratadine & Telfast every day which has helped to reduce the attacks to 2-3 per month. By sheer luck & perserverence I think I have found my solution, I started taking Sertraline 50 mg/day in November 2011 and have only had 1 attack in 10 months. The sertraline has reduced my stress and I guess the angioedema. Hope this helps any other desperate & frustrated sufferer.",

            "answer": "First time on this site- I'm looking for support not about treatment options, but just to check-in with people trying to shape their lives around living with this condition. I was diagnosed with HAE III in 2008 after a lifetime of unexplained and misdiagnosed symptoms. Fortunately, my cousin was diagnosed first and had advice that helped me- including seeing an allergist who vonsulted directly with her doctor to find out what worked for her. So I've been on Danazol 600 mg per day and that has lessened the frequency and intensity of the episodes. She loses her airway and gets injections of the latest drug in the ER when needed. My throat, tongue, neck and stomach swell, but not life threatening so far. What brought me to the ER was a peculiar set of symptoms that included swelling, but also mental status changes- really slowed down thinking, slurred speech, chest pain, vertigo, and spacial distorions. They thought it was basilar migraine, ot a TIA, a neoroligist said I had markers for MS but no confirmed diagnosis, my pulse also slowed to 50, and I had trouble breathing- like I was breathing through ash in a fire. Prednizone lessened the symptoms over time- it took about two months to be functional- though I went to work with shorter dats and a lot of fatigue. After I found an allergist and was diagnosed, I improved with Danazol, Benedryl and Pepcid occasionally- that's what my cousin found helped some with the trouble eating I was having.Episodes are still pretty bad with fatigue, difficulty thinking, stomach pain, chest pain, weight gain overnight, minor throat swelling and pressure headaches- which I take to be swelling of the neck muscles like you get with whiplash, and joint pain. Doctors don't see the thinking and head pressure as part of HAE but it all happens together, and my cousin experiences the same symptoms, only hers can still be life threatening.Triggers include dental work, physucal trauma (I was in a fender bender that triggered an episode), prolonged computer work, stress and not enough \"horizontal time\" compared with physical strain like moving, gardening, etc.I can tell when one's coming on by a few things- fatigue, joint pain, and having trouble completing an easy sudoku when I normally finish hard ones in less time. When the symptoms get incapacitating, I use a three day course of Prednizone which doesn't help the swelling, but does jump start my brain and reduces the fatigue and joint pain.It's difficult when there is so much emphasis on the swelling, because for me the other symptoms are incapacitating, hence my need for support. Sometimes I think maybe I don't have HAE but another autoimmune disorder but I've been tested for RA, MS, Lupus. Another common symptom in my family in general is vitamin D deficiency, which a lot of us take 50000 per week for.Anyine else out there have these other CNS symptoms?",

            "answer": "Allow me\u00a0\u00a0a moment to walk you through my journey with angioedema. My journey began to rapidly increase in 2009.\u00a0\u00a0I remember in my early twenty\u2019s that a small area on my nose would swell. It was very noticeable just uncomfortable, I never thought anything of it. I was a server at a local restaurant in town and I remembering coming home and not being able to walk on my feet once I took my shoes off because my feet hurt so bad.Fast forward, in my late twenty\u2019s\u2026. I became pregnant with my first child, I was approximately 7 months along and sitting at home alone and my tongue swelled up. I specially remember eating a ham lunchable and drinking a bottled water. I went to the doctor and they had no clue what had caused it. They administered benadryl and prednisone. The swelling went down with in about 15 minutes. I began having more swellings, feet, fingers, hand, etc\u2026.. I ended up delivering about 6 weeks early due to preeclampsia that turned into full blown toxemia . After I delivered, I was hospitalized for 9 days due to health. It first started out that they couldn\u2019t keep my blood pressure down but once they got it under control, my swelling kicked in. It was my tongue again =[My swellings began happening sporadically; I would have an episode then would go months while out any. Some months I would have swellings that would range from minor finger to tongue. I would have a 2 or 3 then go a week have another then month with no symptoms\u2026.. Then BAM, I would have another large swelling.Slowly after time, the swellings went from months in between, to monthly, weekly and now daily. Yes, that\u2019s right, DAILY!\u00a0\u00a0These swellings would occur in my fingers, hands, arms, lips, checks, eyes, nose, feet, tongue, throat, and even by butt.I have had testing:skis test & blood test= only allergic to cats (low)Thyroid=normalLymphoma & lupus= negativeI have tried a series of medications, Zantac, Pepcid, Benadryl, prednisone, z-pack, AllegraThey recently started my on 2 other meds that I don\u2019t even know how to spell, but they are stronger than bendryl.They are wanting to start me on Plaquenill\u2026\u2026\u2026 but it scares me.I was told there is new medicine that they are trying to get approved for allergies/angioedema\u2026..maybe Zolzar?I felt I wasn\u2019t getting anywhere, what was wrong with me? So I adventured out to the Cleveland Clinic.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t help either. They didn\u2019t know anything more than what I did and prescribed me the stronger meds.It is hard to have two small children at home, work 40+ hours a week and takes these meds. It causes me to miss a lot of work. I try to work through my swellings but it is very difficult and I can\u2019t seem to stay awake.\u00a0\u00a0By the time I get home, I can\u2019t stay awake\u2026my girls ask: Mommy why do you have a pumpkin face? Are you sick again? It breaks my heart =[The doctors say that I might go my entire life and never find a cure. So, in the meantime, I have to learn to manage it. But, how am I to manage an intermittent disease? Even when I am trying to prevent the swellings, they still keep coming on.We went to Disney world and I spent two days at the resort with a swollen tongue. I have changed eating habits, laundry detergents, change of scenery, perfumes, eliminated caffeine, and still no change.The swellings now take longer to go down. Only bendryl and prednisone will reduce/eliminate the swelling. Before it would take 15 mins-1 hour. Now it takes 4 hours- 48 hours to go down.My worry is\u2026.will it attack my organs? No one has an answer for that yet\u2026so I have been told.Yesterday, my right eye, tongue, throat, hand and lips swelled. This was one of the most server episodes that I had. I constantly tired, feel spaced out sometimes, and very stressed out.",

            "answer": "I also have idiopathic angioedema. I was diagnosed with angioedema when I was 16, in 2009 when I had chronic, random, severe swelling come up all over my body. In 2010 I saw an angioedema specialist in Dallas, Texas, who verified that it was idiopathic angioedema. At the time my symptoms started I had just gotten the depo birth control shot, which triggered my angioedema. The specialist I saw in Dallas told me to steer clear of all birth control as well as any medicines that end in 'plir'\u00a0\u00a0(blood pressure meds) because they tend to cause outbreaks in angioedema patients. My hands and feet stay swollen, usually with little pain. However, for the first time in nearly 3 years I can hardly walk because the swelling is so bad and I am in much pain. My lips have also been swelling up lately, which makes me very uneasy because I do not want my throat or face to swell up again. I'm wondering if it is something to do with the change in weather? I wish there was medicine that angioedema patients could take! Zyrtec and Zantac (H1 and H2 blocker) is what I've always been told to take, but it has never seemed to help. I've heard of plasma infusions they do in Europe that eliminate most or all symptoms, but it is not FDA approved for the U.S. Anything would be worth trying! Does anyone else know of any treatments?",
