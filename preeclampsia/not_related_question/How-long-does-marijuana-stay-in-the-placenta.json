That's a first to me. \"my friend told me that it doesn't matter if you smoked once or a thousand times, marijuana will show up in the placenta and in the babies poop\" I have NEVER heard of this. It is not true. A friend of mine smoked A LOT before she knew she was pregnant and is still continuing to smoke it. She has had 4 different ultrasounds and it does not show marijuana in the placenta! Idk where your friend got that info from but its wrong.",

Some of the THC can be stored in fatty tissues. When you work out, and you happen to work off the fatty tissue the THC is stored in then it can show up in your system. To what extent you'd need to smoke, gain weight and work out I'm not too sure.You'll be just fine! :D",

It showed up on all my drug tests but they didn't tell me. After 3 or 4 months, the thc will stay in your babies meconium (poop) anyways they didn't tell me my drug tests were positive and when my baby was born a nurse came in and told me that I couldn't change his first diaper but didn't tell me why so I got mad and when he pooped I changed him anyways and they had put a small little pack with some kind of stuff in it in his diaper. Since they didn't tell me what it was I assumed it was nothing and threw it away. Turns out they were drug testing his poop and didn't tell me so I wouldn't try to tamper with it, but I didn't know what it was and threw it away so long story short, the nurse was really upset with me but there was nothing they could do. I spent the next month at home terrified that someone was going to come take my baby away... DO NOT smoke weed with your baby... They WILL try to harass you about it! After about 3 or 4 months, it WILL show up in babies system! Please listen to me this is no joke.",

DCFS does not accept hotline calls for infants when the mother is positive for marijuana only, and it is not usually true that the marijuana will stay in the baby\u2019s system, placenta or meconium for that long, especially if her initial drug test was negative. It would be true of cocaine, however, if she used cocaine during the last 4-5 months of her pregnancy. I think that is true for heroin, also. She could get a hotline call if she used either of those.\u00a0\u00a0I would, however, encourage her to enter a drug treatment program if she is open to that and really concerned, since\u00a0\u00a0it is not a good idea to use any type of mood-altering substance, alcohol or drugs, when pregnant. And of course, we have programs to treat for drug abuse. If she is really only using marijuana, and has stopped, she might only qualify for a drug education program.\u201d",
