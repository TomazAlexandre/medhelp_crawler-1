Mention it to your doctor there's things they can give that might help and it's something they need to know about anyways. Mine have gotten progressively worse and now at 37 weeks I just want baby to come so it stops (or I can take sow thing that actually works on me) ....

            "answer": "I get terrible headaches as well, and yes you should talk to your doctor about it soon bc they do tend to get worse and more frequent as the pregnancy progresses. My doctor prescribed me Amitriptyline about a week ago for them. You take one at night to prevent headaches instead of having to take something throughout the day to try to get rid of them, and it's worked wonders for me far. It also makes me sleepy so I take it at night before bed and I sleep GREAT, which at 26 week's, I was also having some trouble with, so it's been an all around win win for me. And perfectly safe for the baby. Good luck!!",
