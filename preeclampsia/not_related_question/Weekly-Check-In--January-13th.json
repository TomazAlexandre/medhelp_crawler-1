            "answer": "I also tested positive for GBS (strep) this week....I was pretty upset about it too, especially because I really wanted to try for a natural birth, and this is going to complicate things. If my water breaks or I lose my plug, they'll want me to the hospital asap, even without contractions, to start me on antibiotics; then they'll probably want to induce, then I'll have to have an epidural, everything I was hoping to avoid!!! But I'm trying to keep in mind that no matter what happens, the only really important thing is a healthy Annabelle.....I'm getting really impatient, especially reading everybody's posts! It seems like I'm the only one without anything starting to happen, and I think I have the earliest due date, Feb. 1st. Other than some pretty uncomfortable BH, Annabelle seems to be pretty happy where she is right now....she's in the right position, but hasn't dropped yet. My midwife doesn't like to do internals either until there's a reason to, so I don't know yet if I've started to dilate or not.Oh well, I guess instead of being impatient, I should be savoring these last few weeks of peace and solitude!",

LOL.\u00a0\u00a0But I started my anti-biotics for the UTI today and will continue them for 7-10 days, so hopefully I start feeling better.\u00a0\u00a0I too am getting more nausea and increased acid reflux - that's one thing I will NOT miss about being pregnant.",

            "answer": "I had a dr. appt today at 10:15am. They did the StepB test and i will have the results by the next. Well in 2 weeks i put on 5lbs. Not great but i'll take it. I also found out i am 1cm dilated and about 70-80% effaced. I have my next appt on 1/21 which includes an u/s b/c at the last u/s Logan weighed in the 97% percentile and they want to check his weight. So it would appear things are moving along quite well. My doctor seems to think i will probably go before my due date. So now i am told to start looking for more contractions and start timing things to see how i am progressing.....Its so crazy to believe that he could come whenever he wants now. This weekend is my baby shower which i am very much looking forward to but also overwhelmed thinkin about.Had to go to the medical dr yesterday i am now on a z-pak for a throat infection ( i get them like every other month cuz i work in a group home and catch all their germs)thats all for now i think,Jonelle",

            "answer": "Solus-you can still have a natural birth! That was one of the first things I questioned because I also would like to go natural. And my doctor said Step B doesn't change that at all. They just like you to get to the hospital as soon as your water breaks so they can get you the IV of Antibiotics and they replace the IV every 4 hours until your deliver. So it won't change anything and doesn't at all mean you'll have to have an epidural. It just means you'll have an IV during the whole labor process. It also doesn't mean they'll induce you...thats completely up to you unless there is a problem and they absolutely need too. So I wouldn't worry, you can still aim to deliver naturally!Jonelle-why aren't you happy with 5 pounds? Thats a GREAT number! I am over 37 weeks and supposed to be putting on 1-2 pounds a week and I've only been putting on half a pound a week, so at your week, 5 pounds is a nice big number!We just gotta hold on a few more weeks ladies, we're almost there!!",

The only thing I was thinking is that it'll make the nurses more eager to induce me, if I have to go in the hospital after my water breaks but before contractions start. I've read that your water can break hours or even days before you actually start labor...not sure how likely that is, though? Oh well, I'm still planning on going natural if at all possible, and I'm excited to hear that you are as well!",

(we wish right!) so you will technically be in labor but like you said it could be hours or even a day! But once your water breaks they like to deliver within 24 hours for the babys safety. So unless you are nearing that 24th hour (or something is wrong with the baby) they wont induce you unless you ask them. It's your choice!Jonelle-You'll find you put on the most weight at this time! I put on so much weight between 28-35 weeks. It just started slowing down at my last appointment. But there was a time I thought I couldn't possibly gain anymore and I would!",

Had to have another NST test done yesterday...which turned into 3 hours..but it all turned out okay. i have to go for another one tomorrow to see how that one comes out. They are just worried about my blood pressure being high and watching things closely. I am very uncomfortable..constantly cramping....and its just not fun.

The first time I was induced so there was plenty of time for the antibiotics as I sat around the first day on pitocin with absolutely nothing happening, I could of went natural but after the next day and 8 hours of contractions and still a long way to go I opted for the epidural which greatly sped up my dilation, I went from 6 to 9.5 in 15 minutes. With this delivery I was nervous as they rushed me in to the c-section but I asked them and they reassured me that they can get them in there in time. So I would advise for those of you who have it, when your water breaks go to the hospital or at least mention it to the on-call OB and see if they want you in immediatley or if you can wait for contractions to be closer together.",

This is my first baby and I don't know everything and I have questions! It made me so mad!I too am concerned with having a big baby...mine measured to be about 6 to 6 in a half pounds at 36 in a half weeks. I am really tiny...100 pounds pre-pregnancy so my family seems to think its impossible to have a big baby but I know that doesnt matter at all! And my stomach is HUGE...like veiny and shiny and stretched to the max! So there has to be a big baby in there right? I mean my belly wouldn't be so big if there wasn't, right? So I am a little worried. I have to wait until my U/S on the 23rd to find out..but no options were even discussed if he was too big. And I feel like if I go full term he will be a 9 pounder! Soo turning 38 weeks on Friday I am SO ready!But I dunno, I don't think I've had any BH contractions unless their not painful and I just brush them off as my baby moving or turning. So that makes me think my body isn't ready...but than I've read things about women never getting or feeling them...AH so the wait continues! We gotta hang in there ladies, but it's tough!",

My husband's mother is like 5 feet tall, and he weighed 9 1/2 lbs, so she had to have a c-section....hearing her horror stories is not making me feel better!!!I've read that doctors are not very accurate when it comes to estimating weight, though, so I don't know that I'd worry about it.Braxton Hicks are not painful....you'll just notice that your \"bump\" suddenly gets incredibly hard for 30 seconds or a minute or so. They don't really hurt, but they can be extremely uncomfortable, you just feel really hot and squeezy and sometimes it's hard to breathe. It's such a weird feeling! I was having 15 - 20 a day for awhile, and then I was less active for a couple of days, and the number went down....so I'm going to start walking a lot again, I'm ready to get this show on the road!!",

    "question": "How is everyone doing?? We're nearing the end here girls!! Some of us are days away, some weeks...can you believe it!?? How is everyone feeling??Well I had my doctors appointment yesterday and the first thing my doctor told me, I tested positive for Strep B. I was so upset..and she acted like it was no big deal. I guess all they do is feed you Antibiotics through an IV during labor but after reading all this stuff about it, it just scares me! But she told me 40% of pregnant women have the bacteria and it was fine. So I still don't know what to think...I'm nervous but trying to deal with it. I've had such a healthy pregnancy, this kinda caught me by surprise.I didn't get an internal (which I was pissed about) I really wanted to see if I dilated more and progressed but she said they usually dont give another internal unless I've been having regular contractions. I swear, I think she was just making things up! Oh at my doctors, they have about 6 OB's and they like you to visit with each one at least once so when I deliver, I will know the on call doctor. So needless to say I did NOT like this particular doctor and PRAY she is not the one on call when I deliver! But anyways, so no internal...but my belly measured great again for the week I'm in..Caiden had a perfet heart beat...and she said he was still so active which is great at this time..means he's nice and healthy. It took her like 3 minutes to get his HB cuz he kept moving! My active little boy...Than she scheduled an U/S for me!!! Which at first freaked me out because I've always been told they don't give you one unless something appears wrong, but she said at this point she wants to check on his growth and make sure he's not too big for me to deliver naturally. She said he looks like an average baby by the size of my belly but you never know. And I haven't had an U/S since 23 weeks! And never had one here with these doctors...so after she explained to me the reasons and she told me there was no concern at all...I was excited! Except the next available appointment isn't until Jan 23rd! I'm not sure I'm going to still be Pregnant then..but if I am, I can't wait to see my baby again and finally find out how much he weighs! But it also makes me a lil uneasy that, this close to my due date I'm not seeing my doctor for 10 days as opposed to every 7 days like I'm used too. But oh well, I'll deal.So that was my appointment...kinda upsetting but happy about the U/S. Other than that I feel good! My nerve pain is completely gone! So I don't know if Caiden moved or what...but I am so happy I can walk and sit and not be in pain! Oh yea and my doctor also said he is still head down...so I can definitely feel that. Like when I stand I feel his head drop in my crotch and its so heavy! My belly feels like it weighs a million pounds! But other than that, I feel great! Still sleeping great and moving around good. Lately I've been getting weird nausea spells...but they go away very quickly and than I eat normally. He's still moving around like crazy...I think he's also getting anxious about coming out! So I am feeling MUCH better this week which makes me so happy being so close to the end..especially since I was in so much pain last week! But I'll be 38 weeks this Friday...AHH thats so surreal! I can't wait until we all start posting about our deliveries!How is everyone else doing??",
