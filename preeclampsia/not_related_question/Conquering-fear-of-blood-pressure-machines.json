            "answer": "Hi,Never had this problem but I know that some people do have it.The only thing that I can suggest it to get your own blood presure machine for home and then start taking it occasionally. If you take it regularly then I would imagine that you will get used to it and then it won;t become a big deal when the nurses take it. You will also see then that BP goes up and down all of the time and it is perfectly normal.The only thing that I would say though is do not do this if you know for a fact that you will become obsessed with taking your BP all of the time and then stressing over the reading. You know that your readings are high but I would imagine that this is through stress. You obviously work yourself up for sometime before the actual event.The only way I have gotten over any of my fears are to face them head on and just keep on with it no matter how awful it is.Good Luck",

            "answer": "Hi Autumn! I see you are still having issues with your BP. I know we discussed ways for you to get over this fear, but either they didn't work, or you didn't try them.Working on a surgical unit in a hospital, I assume most of you can imagine the number of BPs and HRs I take in the course of my shift. Literally hundreds! And I take them on many people who have the same fear as you. In a way, it's not really a fair analogy because folks who are in the hospital are generally in pain, on heavy duty drugs and are afraid. Their blood pressures reflect all of those. Which is why we repeat it through out the day. I had one patient, a young woman in her late 30's who was petrified of having her BP taken because it was always high. DUH! Fear=HBP. One day, as an experiment, I walked in to take her BP and could see her tense up immediatley. This gal, by the way, was NOT on any medication, had NOT had surgery, was NOT in pain and was going home in a few hours after having gotten some VERY good news about her \"condition.\" I took her BP and it WAS high. But I knew she was stressed about the procedure. When she asked me what it was, I told her the lead had come lose from the machine and it hadn't been able to read her BP. So while I pretended to fuss with the machine, I asked if her daughter was going to be a princess, AGAIN, for Halloween, which got us to laughing and talking about all the silly things WE had dressed up as kids, and what we'd go out as now all these years later and That really got us to howling and it was then that I pushed the button, but she was still laughing so hard she didn't realize I was taking her BP until, as they say, it was \"too late!\" Her BP was the lowest she had ever seen it. When I started to take the cuff off, she said \"NO! Do it again!\" I told her it was unlikely the numbers would be that low again as she was now going to focus on her fear, but she insisted, so I did. Her BP was a smidge LOWER than last time.I'm not trying to say I'm some sort of magician, I'm not. SHE was the one who had the epiphany that day! It became clear to her what her fear was doing. Before she left the hospital that day, she had me take he BP 6 more times! The numbers varied by only a few points, which is normal. Was she \"cured?\" Who knows. I haven't seen her since but I have a feeling she learned that day what fear can do.Kind of a long story to emphasize that by focusing on fear, you will always present with higher numbers. And one other thing, by sitting at one of those drug store BP machines and taking your BP 15 times in rapid succession is NOT a good thing to do! That cuff squeezes pretty tight and after 2 or 3 times, your blood vessels are saying \"well, this doesn't feel so real good, so we obviously need to pump HARDER when we get squished!\" Guess what happens by the time you've done that to them 10 times? And you should always relax for at least 10 minutes before taking your BP at one of those places since more than likely you've been running around like a chicken with no head doing errands and you plop down in the chair, relieved to be off your feet, out of breath, you shove your arm in the cuff and push the button.......and guess what? Next time, pick up one of the magazines they usually have laying about, stick your arm in the cuff but do not push the button! Spend at least a good 5-10 minutes reading a \"fun\" article, do NOT read the \"10 Warning Signs of Impending Death From High Blood Pressure!\" Read about some horribly expensive spa that none of us will EVER be able to afford and just let your mind drift.............forget the hustle and bustle going on around you, forget all the things you still have left to get done.....take a good deep breath and push the on button but continue to read, do anything but stare at the numbers! When the machine is done, it will beep, you won't miss what your reading was. But I promise you, you'll be surprised.I know I've gone over how to deal with a home monitor and not get yourself totally obsessed with that, so I won't repeat myself. If you want to talk about that again, please PM me and I'll be happy to walk you through it as many times as you need!You can do this. It's mind over matter.Keep me updated!PeaceGreenlydia",

            "answer": "Two issues. As regards blood pressure that is a specific health issue I am not familar with so I can't offer specific advice. Post in the forum for that. Of course if your anxiety disorder speeds up your blood pressure then that's another issue but both need to get under control. But I never found blood pressure machines unnerving. Many things that were unnerving I got used to such as weekly bloodtests from Clozaril (which I was on years ago). After a while they were just a fact of life and I would get them once a week and head off to work. As for blood pressure I have a blood pressure machine. I was on Atenolol for a while (to control e.p.s., when I was on conventional antipsychotics) then Clonidine (to control dystonic spasms) and now Tenex (same purpose although both serve as mood stabilizers, as well). More importantly, taking my blood pressure is standard and as well I take Zofran (for tardive dyskinesia, although it has somewhat of a mood stabilizing effect) as well since both drop blood pressure, when titrating the medications at first it went way low and I did have to call my neurologist and psychiatrist asap. But the machine itself is harmless.As for being concerned about blood pressure that's important but I noticed after I had a minor disagreement with someone my pulse went way up so controlling anxiety will help and stress is good for no one. Its important to remember people with anxiety disorder do blow worries out of proportion. That's true. But unless someone is experiencing psychosis as I did before recovery then the worries are not entirely unrealistic. We can't hide from them but we must understand them factually. Then they don't seem frightening to begin with. If you don't have a blood pressure disorder reading books on it will just scare you but if you do need to monitor for blood pressure then just consider it something to balance out and what are the proper numbers. The more its approached logically the less time you'll have for anxiety and that may help overall with life's issues if it could be extended to other matters.",

I thought I was the only one in the world having this fear and felt stupid and ashamed to speak about it.It's become a nightmare. I find myself thinking about it and how to get over it or trying to take it by myself as if I had to prove that I'm brave and strong.It all became when I had my BP taken by doctors in an ambulance.I was waiting for a coach to take me to the airport where I had to catch a flight back home. My nose started bleeding. I never had that problem before. I felt a bit shocked and worried. What if I missed my plane home? What do I do now? I'm alone, I don't know anybody. I saw an ambulance and asked the operators for some ice. They decided to take my BP to stay on the safe side. I sat inside teh ambulance and when they started the procedure my train of thoughts took the control. I felt I was about to panic and just for a moment I thought \" What if it's high? I'm gonna be stuck here, they'll send me to the hospital and I'll never be able to go back home. My parents will be informed and will be so worried and we'll have to come to the hospital.\" I saw myself lying in a bed, desperate, alone in a hospital, being scared by the sad and worried faces of the doctors looking at me as if I was hopeless. The pressure that day was just a bit higher than normal because I felt my pulse accelerating. I felt the need to justify it and felt a bit hurt by their comments and even ashamed.Since then I've been totally, literally petrified everytime I see the BP monitor machine. I've been tempted to buy it myself several times but as I tried once and felt a need of escaping I just abandoned the thought.I\u00a0\u00a0'm sorry for those of you who have my problem but at the same time I feel relieved!

However happy to say after many sessions I am pretty much panic free. Apart form medical procedures (I can live with this). Whilst on holiday I had a weird bite/blister and had to go to hospital just to get it looked at. Well I got myself in a right old state. Had a full on panic attac! Sily really got into the docs he said it was fine, cleaned it up, gave me some anti\u2019s and that was it! (felt silly for getting in a big tizz, but that\u2019s me and part of who I am). Well during this process they too my BP! I didn\u2019t even think about it being high even though my hb was about 160! I had the shakes, was hyperventilating and had palpitations. The doc just said hmmm that\u2019s quite high then said but your stressed and didn\u2019t appear overly concerned.As I left the docs I had a print out of my experience and there it was 168/99 said hypertension risk! At that point I should have just processed why! But no not me. I thought \u201cwhat if I have BP problems\u201d even though I had looked on the internet and see that when we panic we release adrenalin which increases the pulse and makes our BP go up all logical. Well I decided to forget about it and was logical until this point my BP had always been fine and I didn\u2019t want to get a phobia about it!Then I fell pregnant. I was over the moon and still am\u2026 however suddenly when reading through my antenatal notes realised that at each visit they take urine and you guessed it BP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I could literally here the theme from psycho ringing through my head. How will I cope, what will I do, I won\u2019t be able to keep calm. Coupled with the fact I know any doc wont be happy if its high, even if I look stressed! As this is one of the main indicators for preeclampsia. I felt desperate.So I thought lets be positive, armed myself with self help books, breathing exercises, whale music. Attended the 12 week scan all went well. Then had my appointment I got in a right panic nearly 9 out of 10. was flushed, had palps, sweating. Took BP, said it would be high and it WAS 160/100!!!! Eeek doc looked abit alarmed. I explained my situ. They didn\u2019t seem to understand. They said I didn\u2019t look stressed ( I have learnt to hide it, plus I don\u2019t fear panics anymore and I knew what was causing this one). He quiet rightly needed to be satisfied he did it again down to 140/90 better! Still I wasn\u2019t relaxed.. Kept messing with cuffs. Well he let me out eventually but still looked slightly uneasy. Which meant I thought he thinks I have high BP when I should have thought he is doing his job, I am pregnant so he has to cover all bases.So I brought a home BP monitor! And now I am obsessed with it. The 1st reading still always high usually 146/75! Usually top figure that is high. Then always goes down to 120 over 70! After a few mins. Its like the first reading is my fear then I calm from there.Yesterday I did yoga was totally chilled but the BP cuff on heart rate shot instantly form 75 beats to 138! And BP was 150 /76 then I relaxed, breathed and it went down consistently to 125 \u2013 130! So I know it always goes down! If I had high BP it wouldn\u2019t always go down it would remain at the same figure. I do really believe deep deep down that I am fine and do not have any BP problems. However I can\u2019t understand at all why I can\u2019t control that first reading.In all other area\u2019s of my life my anxiety has disappeared. Maybe its just my way of putting some control into my pregnancy!All I do know is I have 8 more appointments (yes I have counted and I cant keep doing this to me or baby). At my 16 weeks appointment the midwife was great, it was 136/86 she said I am totally fine with it, not worried at all. Thought it would be higher.I know all the logic, I understand all the logic. I just cant stop that immediate reaction when the cuff goes on. Its helped just to write all this down!Any advice welcomex",

When I take it at home a few times in a row, I can get it as low as 115/70, I just cannot for the life of me stop the panic attacks from happening whenever I go to the doctor and have it taken by someone else. Like others have said it is about 50% a fear of comments from the nurses or the doctor, or fear they will tell me I need medication. I seriously think about all the times I will have to have my BP taken in the future and proceed to freak out about them months in advance... it's as bad or worse than the needle phobia I used to have as a kid.

            "answer": "I feel like laughing to know that I'm not alone in this irrational fear. Next time I'm in a dr's office, I'll think of all of you, feeling the same way and take strength from the fact that it's not just me! I'm having a minor outpatient surgery next week and have to see a cardiologist tomorrow because, you guessed it, my heart rate was about 120 while getting my pre-op evaluation. I've had this problem since I was little--first it was just about doctor's offices, and the past 10 years, it's focused solely on the blood pressure machine. Fear of a high reading, which makes the reading high. It's a vicious cycle.My phobia is the result of behavioral conditioning, I'm certain. For most of my childhood, I had\u00a0\u00a0many emergency room visits for asthma and acquaint medical settings with needle sticks, an adrenalin rush, pain, discomfort and a lot of negativity. It's very hard to overcome this. Someday I hope to pursue behavioral conditioning therapy for this and remedy it.Here are the things which have helped me.1. Get a good doctor. It makes a big difference to see the same provider at each visit. You can develop a rapport and your freakout won't come as a shock to them.2. Monitor your own bp/heart rate at home. I use a battery-operated wrist cuff, which I feel is my 'friend' while those giant old-fashioned doctor's office monitors are just plain evil. I keep a record of my readings and go over them with my doctor at visits so that she can get a better assessment of how my bp meds are working. I spent several years on a high dose of heart meds that I didn't really need, because of seeing a provider who was dismissive of my history/phobia. A good doctor will listen and try to help make things easier for you.3. Long slow exhalations while they are squeezing the cuff will help lower your reading and relax you. Keep your \"out breath\" longer than your \"in breath.\"4. I ALWAYS tell the nurse/dr. that it's going to be high, that I'm nervous and try to make a joke out of it. Smiling and laughing help decrease anxiety.5. have them take your BP again at the end of your visit. The first one is usually the worst one. Once that's over, it's tends to go down.6. I also have a general anxiety disorder, for which I'm now taking 10 mg of Prozac, and it has changed my life. My fears are manageable. I still get nervous, but I can anticipate and detach from the feelings, rather than drowning in them. I am still anxious but I can get through my appts., rather than running out of the office (yep, it's true), crying, or hiding in a stairwell because I couldn't face the ordeal of a simple BP reading.7. You can plan to give yourself a little reward after your visit.\u00a0\u00a0It's nice to have something to look forward to. A special dessert, or manicure or new CD, half an hour of bookstore browsing, whatever you like.8. If you have a partner who will go with you, it helps to have a loved one nearby holding your hand. When I was pregnant, the midwives would always take my husband's blood pressure too, and it helped cut the tension.Hope my tips help!",

I never had high blood pressure but when I had a 4 month old baby at home, I became pregnant again and was pretty freaked out about it. The nurse at my OB/GYN went to take my blood pressure and I began throwing my arm in the air. She managed to come up with a 190/90 or so and that stayed on my records and each doctor I saw would bring it up. I was so silly, I never mentioned that I was moving my arm to get away from it when she did it - it just did something to me and now I'm deathly afraid of getting it done. It's all so silly and I don't even know why I'm afraid. My mom worked for a doctor when I was a child and whispered about patient's problems and I would ask her about it, she would say \"you don't need to worry abou this until your an adult\" - then I became an adult and all these things are unresolved.I also dealt with anxiety, I've conquered most of it through my relationship with God but this is the last unconquered problem. I'm almost 65 and I stay far away from doctors just because of this - this is so wrong!!!I also went through a few semisters of nursing school and I picked up how to do BP's really quick but I freaked when they practiced on me.

I am not afraid of blood draws, etc. Actually I am a nurse practitioner myself and work in an ICU taking care of critically ill patients. I have been afraid ever since my pre-nursing school physical exam when I was 19. I had never worried about BP before. They had an all day \"admission\" full physical, blood draws, vaccinations, etc., one person right after another in line. The LAST thing they did was check my blood pressure after all of that poking and prodding all day, and it was a foreign male medical assistant who would not make eye contact. He took the pressure, frowned, shook his head in disgust, pumped it up again, frowned, pumped it up again, several times! I finally said enough! What are you doing? He acted like it was none of my business and mumbled under his breath. He wouldn't tell me what was going on. I became terrified. The nurse came in and took it and it was high, 140/90, but she explained that we would retest it when I came back to get my TB test checked in 48 hours. Well, guess what I obsessed over for the next 48 hours. When I came to get the TB test checked, I thought for sure they wouldn't remember, but then I saw a yellow sticky note on the chart \"Recheck BP! High!\" and I panicked, started shaking. It was 126/80 and she said that was perfectly normal. But I was ruined. Another time I went to the doctor and she kept yelling at me: calm down! calm down! she said there was no reason to be nervous. This made it worse and worse. She decided that I needed to get my thyroid checked b/c of high heart rate and BP.I do have generalized anxiety disorder but this is my only \"focal\" fear. Everything else is just general anxiety. I feel like the first step in everything is to check a BP. Every time you go to the doctor it's the first thing, it's at health fairs. I went to a spa in Arizona and guess what the first thing they wanted to do on check-in? BP!!! I refused. They looked at me like I was crazy. I worked at a nursing home in college and bumped my head very mildly. Guess what the nurse wanted to do? That's right, a BP!!I have a cuff at home and just the other day, started putting it on my arm and walking around for a while with it, at the advice of my therapist. I was even able to pump the cuff up a few times, just to 60. But it's a start. I cannot let this consume my life anymore! I want to have a baby and cannot imagine all of the BP's that will be taken and will terrorize me!Thanks to everyone for sharing your stories, everyone's is different but we all share the same problem and it makes me feel better :-)",

All the participants were lined up for our bloodpressure, which we had done every four hours or so, and I just remember the anticipation of what mine was going to be compared to everyone else's really sent my pulse soaring along with my blood pressure. I don't have a fear of the machine itself; it is a fear of having no control over it-- I become convinced that I'm going to fail it, which in turn causes me to fail it. My heart will go soaring sometimes over 150 bpm, and systolic can vary from 132-155 or so. This irrational fear is only in a clinical setting or any setting where someone else is looking at my numbers. I'm in nursing school now, and one day a fellow student tested the cuffs on me to listen for the sounds of Koritkoff, and my heart went racing again. If I'm at home or using one of those machines at Wal-Mart, I register 118/75 to 130/75 or so.I just had a prenursing school physical and registered 146/76-- again high due to my phobia.

            "answer": "Thanks for your advice and all the posts as it's reassuring to know you are not on your own with this, as I too have the same problem and tend avoid the situation until I psyche myself up. I also have never liked shots or blood pulls but just have to go through the barrier with it (even though my BP probably won't be in a good state at the time, so i'd never have the two done at the same time). It is the result of the BP that used to freak me out more (and still does to some extent like others have said its like a pass or fail test and you are being judged and it makes be panic) and having no control once it starts up. I have had CBT and that has really helped but that is all I have had. I have a home monitor now which I normally keep out of sight and rarely use, however if I use it I need to psyche myself and feel calm enough to take the reading. With your advice I took a few readings today, at the top end 161/80 and a few more slightly less down to 148/ 74, then watched photos on of our family camping holidays and relaxed more and 12 minutes later it was down to 131/78 where my pulse seem to settle to normal. So this\u00a0\u00a0good for me as my target BP is 130/x. In the surgery I have been up to 190+ / x but 157/x being my best reading in there, so if I could get 140/x in the surgery I would be happy with that, small steps at a time I guess. Also I keep fit regularly and am normal weight and eat well and watch my sodium / salt intake. I am on 2 x BP meds as well and have been for the past 1\u00a0\u00a01/2 years of which this combination is all helping as this does run in my family without doubt, for me accepting it is a big part of it.",

(I wanted to discuss having a baby after I got married at age 38).\u00a0\u00a0I guess the fear was really strong that day because my BP reading was something ridiculous like 170/120!\u00a0\u00a0I was feeling extremely anxious when it was taken.\u00a0\u00a0(I probably shouldn't have used my mother's gyno since she put that seed in my head in the first place)!\u00a0\u00a0The nurse started saying \"It can't be THAT high....but it IS!!!\" and she literally ran out the door to get the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He actually ran in and said \"Well I've never lost a patient before but you might be the first one.\"\u00a0\u00a0Of course that terrified me and I could feel the adrenaline rushing through me like a freight train.\u00a0\u00a0He took my blood pressure and it apparently was even higher.\u00a0\u00a0He kept taking it over and over and I was getting more and more horrified and felt like my head was going to explode.\u00a0\u00a0He called in about 3 nurses and took it again and they started going \"Whew!!\".\u00a0\u00a0I tried to explain to him that I had a phobia of having my BP taken but he just wouldn't listen to me.\u00a0\u00a0He started saying that I could have a stroke, heart attack or go into convulsions.\u00a0\u00a0Of course by this time I was beside myself with terror and embarrassment.\u00a0\u00a0He came at me with that cuff again and one of the nurses said he should leave me alone before I got into trouble for real, especially if it was only anxiety and that he was making it worse.\u00a0\u00a0I refused to let him take it again.\u00a0\u00a0He made me go to the emergency room (I had to drive myself there in that messed up condition).\u00a0\u00a0When I got there they took it and it was through the roof.\u00a0\u00a0I could barely function I was so scared.\u00a0\u00a0So then they sent me to the waiting room and it was an hour before they called my name.\u00a0\u00a0When I got back there a kind nurse told me that the doctor who said all those things should have his butt kicked.\u00a0\u00a0She said that if they'd thought something was really wrong with me they'd have taken me back when I first got to the emergency room.\u00a0\u00a0I guess it's needless to say I never got pregnant because there was no way I could handle all the BP monitoring because of this stupid phobia.So needless to say, now I have a SEVERE phobia of having my BP taken and it causes me to avoid going to the doctor at all costs pretty much.\u00a0\u00a0I finally went to see a very kind doctor a little over a year ago for my female exam.\u00a0\u00a0It had been almost 7 years since I'd had one.\u00a0\u00a0I'd gone to him the 7 years before and my BP was through the roof but he didn't seem to freak out at all, he said he knew I was just nervous.\u00a0\u00a0But it still took me 7 years to go back because it's just so traumitizing to have my BP taken even though I KNOW he won't freak out about it.\u00a0\u00a0This last time I told him that I take my BP at home and it's in the normal range and I didn't let them take it.\u00a0\u00a0Like a lot of you even when I take it myself it starts off high but after I calm down it's usually in the range of low 100's over 70 something.That horrible day in 1995 absolutely ruined me as far as ever being able to have a normal reading at the doctors office.\u00a0\u00a0It amazes me how my mind can affect my body like that.I'm sure I need professional help but even talking to anyone about it makes me so uncomfortable and I can feel my chest tighten up and I get this feeling like a freight train is running through my veins.\u00a0\u00a0I know I need to grow up, face it and get over it but there are no words to describe how fearful I am.\u00a0\u00a0I do feel a little better after typing this.",

I will tell you one thing that did help me out this morning when I took it. The first one I took was high because I wanted it to be great and the pressure on myself was crazy. The first one was like 160/88. So I layed down, did some deap breathing exercises for about 5 minute of maybe a little more. Then I got up and did this.................played with my dog!!!! Yes I rubbed my cocker spaniels ears with the hand that wasn't being used. The reading came down to 135/83. So I guess the trick for all of us, is to find a way to distract ourselves from what is going on. I am like another person here who said they stressed over their readings almost every hour. I run, I work out. I eat right and all, but I do have that dang anxiety thing. We will get through it. We will win!!!!",

My doc said to do this,and to show him the readings after a week of taking it. I did and the readings were fine. But he did caution me about taking it to much.He said you don't want to get obcessed with it.I must admit,I have taken it up to 10 times a day though.

            "answer": "My name is Joe and I'm a 23 year old from ny. In April I went to see my doc bc I have mild asthma and needed a refill. When I saw him everything was fine and then he told me I had a little high cholesterol. it was 214 but to me it was a death sentence. You see I've always been worried about my body. I guess you could call me a hypochondriact. Anyway about 2 years ago my doc told me I had hayfever. While I was sick I felt a weird thing in my chest that I've never felt before. I ended up in the er with my mother to find out I had BENIGN PVCs. But it sucked to feel them. Anyway I've always eaten as healthy as anyone can bc I'm obsessed with staying on this earth as long as possible. I love myself as a person and have a great faith for the man upstairs. So back to the cholesterol, yeah I find out I had high cholesterol and during the process I freaked put. Then took my blood pressure and it was 120/80 which was normal. And I freaked over that! bc my pressure was usually 109/70. So for days I'd take my bp constantly then it went up to 150/100. I was doomed. Any way I ate even more healthy just hoping my cholesterol would drop. I came in 5 months later and it dropped 40 points! I was estatic yet now my mind was on my bpressure. I went to my heart doc and he said it was 128/78. It was good enough as I went back to my reg doc and he said 130/75. Now I feel when ppl hear it's 130 or over that your doomed. So a couple weeks ago I injured one of my ribs. No big deal so I went to the doc. The nurse who I trust came in and knows i didn't like my bp taken so she asked me and I told her u know what? U can do it go ahead just don't tell me. Everything was great doc came in and said everything normal. So as I left my eyes happened to glance in the wrong direction and boom! There it was 140/82. I saw my number that I feared. So that day I found my mother told me I was going to Vegas bc my gma wasn't doing well. Ive also feared flying since having PVCs bc I didnt want to get them on a plane from altitude etc. But I went and when I was there for the worst most horrific terror of a week I've ever had in my life, I ended up alive. I slept a whole 8 hours in 5 days and had panic attacks about 10 times each day that lasted for hours. I think when tour in a panic attack like that your afraid you won't come out so u go in deeper and deeper into the dark cold place. Your trapped and there's no way out. So I came back home with my pupils dilated to crisps. I was so terrified that started keeping my eyes open seeing how long it would take me to blink. I kept them open for 23 minutes straight. Then blinked on my own bc I felt it should be normal to blink LOL. (no really not funny at all tho.) but yeah so yesterday I meet up at Perkins with two of\u00a0\u00a0my best friends. It's funny how fate works out. So my friend Joe tells me hey Joe ( yeah were both named Joe), I went to the doc today and thought of u while getting my bp taken. He sed it was 137/77. He was laughing asking if it was normal. And my other friend who is 25 and had a heart transplant at 7 was laughing also. So my friend goes hey how about we solve this once and forall. We went to cvs to get our blood pressure taken. My friend mike with the transplant goes first. It's 181/116. He doesn't care. To him hes here on borrowed time. Now my other friend Joe goes and it's 138/91. Were all nervous lol. I go it's 142/91. I didn't really care at this point bc I said if my friend are like this too then well die together lol. My friend decides let's take it ONE MORE TIME. Best thing that ever happened in my entire life. my friend with heart trans goes. Its 160/106. For him thats normal ppl. Mind you he's had that heart for 18 years. My friend joe goes. It's 135/83. I go.... This whole 2011 of terror could it finally be nearing an end? Will I be my loving caring self again? Would it ever go back to 109/70? All these times that I was relaxed and saying if they only but the bp cuff on me now it would be low! But then my heart raced thinking about it bc maybe it was high? But I go again. BOOM! 120/75. Its all over folks And the Yankees (my favorite baseball team) wins it in the bottom of the 9th. I slept last night btw. For 15 hours straight. You see the mind plays tricks on you and YES when your anxious your bp WILL indeed rise. All the sufferers out there know that I love you and care for you. It will be ok. YOU will be OK. Bc I used to think even was I was relaxed it was high. But it wasn't. And it isn't for you either I promise. Bc the more anxious you are the more it goes up but it WILL come back down. But how do you know? If you can't take it without feeling anxious? Here my story. And know that you don't have high blood pressure, that you will be alright, and know that there's a guy in ny somewhere that has a couple of knucklehead friends, but helped him overcome this terror of bp machines. It comes down if you let it. Trust me, trust my story, and most importantly, trust your body. This world is made to lice in peace not terror. -Joe",

            "answer": "Had to comment, though this thread is old. I am a mental health therapist so I understand how powerful the mind is, and my experience with bp readings is a perfect example of that. I am a middle aged woman, and all of my life had normal bp, aside from a couple of somewhat elevated diastolic (lower number) readings in my 20s when I was very stressed. Didn't give it much thought and had a wonderful old family doctor who never made me feel like there was anything wrong with me when he took my bp. Sadly, he passed away several years ago and I had to find a new doctor. I went to him for the first time quite worried because I had been dizzy for several months (turned out just benign positional vertigo, which I recovered from with exercises). Plus, I expect at middle age and hitting menopause, I WAS experiencing some small elevation in bp. But when he looked at chart and saw reading of 148/70 something, he asked if my bp was always so high. I told him no, I was just nervous. But the next visit I was worried about it for the first time and it increased systolic (top number) by about 10 pts. So he put me on bp med. You guessed it. Every time after that it increased until I was getting readings of 188/70s. He was a doctor with a very poor bedside manner and insisted it could only increase about 10-20 pts from anxiety. General anxiety, yes, I tend to agree. But when someone is having a panic reaction to the machine, it can zoom. And the proof is in these posts. I got a machine at home and started taking it. Like so many of you have noted, it is often high on first reading, then goes way down on second and down further on third, to a good number. Unless something has caused a higher than normal first reading, I can have months of even pretty good readings on first reading. I switched doctors and have one who completely understands white coat hypertension. He takes my pressure again after I have been in office about 15 minutes and it goes way down - last time by 40 pts. And he has tested my machine from home for accuracy. So he believes that it is only panic causing initial very high pressure (been as high as 200/120 there). I still hate having it taken at his office though, when I first get there and the nurse takes it. And sometimes I get in a state about taking it at home. But it helps to remind yourself that blood pressure rises during exertion too, often extremely high, and this is normal. And believe that it is just an \"in your head\" situation. As much as the mind can cause you trouble, it also has the same power to do you good. Taking it regularly at home, maybe once or twice a week, keeps you \"used to\" it without being obsessed by it. I also think the medical profession in general is woefully ignorant in regard to white coat hypertension. Additionally, medical professionals should be taught how to talk to patients and remember their Hippocratic Oath, \"First, do no harm.\" It is shameful when people we turn to for help cause further harm instead. That doctor who told one of the writers above he might lose a patient should have been severely disciplined. Good luck to you all. I feel your pain!",

I normally have to take a copy of my tracker from here when I visit my doctor so he can see how\u00a0\u00a0my numbers are at home. First off, taking multiple readings is never a good idea, but if you are going to do it, you need to wait at least 5 mins between readings to let your arteries recover. Second readings will always be understated if taken too soon.Also, you anyone else reading this thread, here's a great read on white coat hypertension;http://www.blood-pressure-monitoring.org/white-coat-hypertension.htm",

A couple of years ago I was working out like a fiend and watching my calories and then went to the doc. They weighed me and I was 10lbs heavier than I thought! My scale at home was broken. I was devastated and I saw white spots and felt my whole face heat up. The assistant walked me back and sat me down and took my blood pressure and it was 157/90. That day the doctor prescribed me blood pressure medication at 20mg of Lisinopril. I went home and took the medication and then felt extremely light headed. I stopped taking it switched doctors and went in for a visit where my blood pressure was 119/76. So basically the moral is how can a doctor diagnose you with High Blood Pressure off of one reading? Safety would say that you should at least check the pressure twice during a visit and NEVER after weighing someone.",

I was in a vicious circle and I was desperate to leave, but they couldn't let me leave with reading like I was getting, 10 days later I told them i was going to discharge myself as without seeming ungrateful they were making me worse, thankfully the cardiologist completely agreed with me, telling them to stop monitoring me. So after a very emotional time for some time after, and a few visits to cardiologist they took me off everything, but the fear is there and I cannot shake it off. We wanted another child but I'm scared and there is no way I'm going through that again.So here we are I have been great, not thinking about it just getting on, until they tell me in work I have to go for a full routine medical...........yep you guessed it, decided to use my wrist bp and it was a fairly okay reading, so I was happy!!! Really happy!!.......i took it the next day it was crap 109/160 with pulse rate of 117!! Anxiety is In full swing I can feel my chest tightening, I want to think just reading these blogs will help, but it's not that easy, my partner cannot believe I have checked my bp, when I was instructed to throw the bloody machine away by my cardiologist!But Im prepared to try anything, I hate not being in control of this.....so I've booked my appointment at the gp's, if it's tablets then fine, cognitive therapy fine, what's not fine is me ignoring the problem I NO this much.Wish everyone luck",

            "answer": "Hi everyone,I am 44 years old and have been on treatment for hypertension for 4 years now. Last year I had an extra tablet added when my bp started to rise consistently again, at the time I was going through a period of unavoidable stress due to life changes. I am now on 2 tablets daily.Up until a couple of months ago I was able to check my bp regularly myself at home using a home monitor. Unfortunatly I started to suffer panic attacks then due to personal issues that I've been dealing long term with, I then got myself in a vicious circle- I started to expect my bp would be up due to the increased anxiety and so bingo it would shoot up. I then had to stop using my home monitor as it was only serving then to increase my anxiety. I now have to visit my nurse or gp if I want a reading as even tho I still get anxious having it taken there, it's nothing compared to the anxiety I experience while taking it myself! Weird I know, as most people are the other way around...normally my bp can be between 120/70-130/80 depending on how I am feeling at the time & when the doc takes it....A month ago I had to go to A&E, turns out I had compression on a nerve in my back which caused severe weakness in my legs. I was nervous of course having my bp checked and it was 160/90. On my examination they were were worried I was having a stroke so brought me into resuss, WELL you can all imagine the fear then!! My bp readings shot through the roof! I was getting readings of 190/110, I was terrified and found it very hard to calm myself internally.Once they established I wasn't having a stroke they got me out of there asap as they knew the anxiety was just pushing my bp up.I was kept in hospital for a week for tests and any time the nurses came near me with the electronic bp machine it would go through the roof, as soon as that cuff went on my arm & the machine was switched on bang, my heart would take off! They had to use the manual bp reader and then it would come down.Basically where I am today in all this is that I worry incessantly about my bp. I have been assured by my Cardiologist that I am fine and that I am on excellent coverage with the meds I am taking.I find I am 'minding' myself a lot lately tho...'Oh I can't do that or I can't do this, it might put my bp up'. I don't smoke & stick to the recommended units of alcohol weekly. I eat healthy & try t exercise by walking, altho I could do better in that area.I am obsessed now though about my bp and can't stop worrying. If I get a headache I worry that it's bad. Last night I had an iffy tummy and woozy head and worried that it was my bp and that something bad would happen.I'm frustrated with myself for being like this as I'm usually a positive & practical person.Doc gave me 0.25 xanax for the anxiety probs but I'm thinking now of going on Prozac for the panic & worry as I am worried the anxiety will do harm if it continues.Good to know I am not alone in this on reading all your posts, and best of luck to everyone in getting the anxiety sorted and the bp fear diminished <3",

Also don't want to take SSRIs either.I finally found a shrink that might be just the right thing for me. She not only does CBT, but also relaxation and stress management training, cognitive and behavioral pain management, biofeedback training, surface EMG, thermal, skin conductance, individual pychotherapy,and medication consultation, done in collaboration with your primary care provider.Treatment is short-term, generally 6-12 sessions, with focus on measuring progress in increasing involvement in meaningful activites.With all of that somethings gotta give.Hope it helps.

I was on them 20 years ago for postnatal anxiety and they worked very well...I had the same symptoms but much lower key... these symptoms are a lot worse now....The reason my doc prescribed them & not a more up to date SSRI is because I was on them before....the way I see it my friend is that why take something to help my anxiety if it's gonna make me more anxious because of the side effects....I've actually heard in a few cases they can put bp up altho my doc says a definate NO on that one....oh this vicious circle of worry is awful! I'm not gonna have any CBT for a month either as my therapist is off on holiday....just at a point when some very tricky stuff for me was brought up.....I have systemic lupus and my next appt at the hospital is June 26th so hoping they will be able to help as they are quiet good at helping with anxiety/stress related issues too.......Thanks for keeping us informed",

I'm going to mention to my doc about the possibility of trying another anti-depressant.....she was keen to keep me to Prozac as I had it 20 years ago for post natal anxiety type depression, and it worked well for me then....however body chemistry changes over time, also I wasn't on the bp tabs then...so I dunno maybe all that is relative. All I know is I've given the Prozac a fair go & really don't feel they are agreeing with me.....I can put up with the prickly skin altho bothersome, and even the nausea/stomach cramps but the tummy probs are getting worse & as for the nightmares!! They're horrific! Also I'm getting restless legs now and I remember that as a side affect before....such a shame really....I will have a look out for the book you mentioned, thanks.

Now I take it daily and most days I do have to do it two or three times until my nervousness subsides. There is no way to get over your fears unless you face them head on. Now my blood pressure is normal and I know that. Whenever I do go to my doctor I will be able to show him that in fact I do nit have high blood pressure. I haven't been back since but I hope I am \"cured\" of my fear. It is so frustrating and it is a cycle.

            "answer": "I'm amazed as to how many people suffer with this specific anxiety. I am part of the club as well. I have had to go to the dentist. Almost a year ago I had to have a root canal and my BP was 200/110. My fear of the cuff inflating as well as having BP taken has been lifelong and then adding having to explain why to the nurses then again to the Dr. And why do they act as if you're the only patient they have that has a high reading. At 57 they look shocked when I say I'm not on BP meds and I get that condecending look as if they think I'm in denial and stupid and don't care if I have a heart attack. I'm overweight and of course they believe it's innevitable, even though the don't know me or my physical state. They look at the package and assume I'm unhealthy.\u00a0\u00a0They don't believe me when I say it's normal everywhere else and look confused. Why are Drs. so off on understanding how a patient can react.They never ask any questions.\u00a0\u00a0Anxiety is real and will spike the BP. So, after the root canal the tooth cracked and they told me I had to have it extracted. A temporary crown was placed on it and about a month ago it fell off and I had to start applying the temp. filling on it and the crack started getting wider. My fear of having to face the whole BP thing again kept me delaying the innevitable. Finally, I made the appt. and expected to have an easier time because they knew my situation. I had IV conscious sedation the first time and of course totally relaxed and BP came right down and the Dr. told me that since it did go down I\u00a0\u00a0would be fine with Nitrous Oxide for the extraction.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I had proven that it was anxiety. I show up for my appointment and the first hour was to apply the overlays and second hour was going to be the extraction. Then everything goes crazy. The doctor I had the first time was no longer there and the new doctor sees my BP and of course here goes the whole explaination and he doesn't even look at my record or what happened before and how my BP came down easily with sedation. He just goes into this rant about how I'm going to have to be IV sedated etc. I suggest the nitrous oxide first to see if that will work. He tells me he's not going to do the overlays because he wasn't scheduled to do sedation and in an arrogant tone keeps saying he really wants to see if any other type of sedation works to bring down my BP of 203/115 other than IV sedation. Of course he's announcing this loudly and everyone in the place can hear him. The oral surgeon comes in to prepare for the extraction. I do like him because he was the one that handled the IV sedation the first time and new my situation. I'm so tired by now but really want my tooth extracted to get it over with. I'm so upset and nervous by now and the nitrous oxide isn't working and nurses are all saying \"You need to relax\". I really hate when they say that. Finally, the oral surgeon tells me he can add a shot to help me relax and see what happens. But it irritates me because he's now also having doubts. His assistant who is monitoring the BP machine was really nice and I could tell she understood what I was going through. She offered me a pillow and sunglasses for the bright light. As usual once the shots kicked in my BP came down like a charm and he did the extraction.Now, I'm still stressed because I have to go back to have the overlays applied and I'm just hoping they don't make a big deal when my BP will probably be just as high. They're going to do the conscious sedation again with the shots.\u00a0\u00a0And still I need to get this done but the stress waiting for the day also has kept my BP in the 150's/86 range. It goes up a little then down a little. I also keep telling myself I have to ignore their reactions and tune out their comments but these doctors and nurses need sensitivity training. They have completely forgotten how to treat the patient with compassion and understanding. I can't help but feel their only interest is to have patients like ourselves on BP meds so that we fit neatly into their box. They don't\u00a0\u00a0care if we suffer the side effects being on meds we don't need.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't understand why this has to be so difficult. We don't do this on purpose. Anxiety is real and yes we all work on trying to fix it so that we \"make\" them happy. Don't they know how humiliating it is for everyone to be discussing your BP as if you're an alien from another planet. It is aggravating which of course keeps our BP's high.\u00a0\u00a0At this point I am going to try very hard to rise above their attitudes and comments and let them think what they want. I know my body and know why. If they don't get it well then that's their problem. I'm not going to be bullied into taking BP meds for something I know I don't have. So to everyone who has posted we know what the deal is and how the anxiety was created and that's all that matters. I also want to thank everyone for sharing their experiences because it has made me feel better just knowing how many other people have this issue.",

            "answer": "I'm pleased I have found this thread because I've had a similiar experience.I am a 43 y/o male and about 5 years ago I was commuting / working very long hours and running up stairs for a train carrying a large heavy briefcase and I felt a twinge in my chest (which I now know was just a muscle pain). I thought I'll go to the doctors just in case and get checked out. I was so nervous as I thought there might be something wrong, my heartrate jumped and my BP showed 160/x. I bought a home monitor and found that every time I used it my heartrate would jump from resting 55-60 right up to 110-120. Sure enough my BP was high. High on the machine at home, higher in the doctors surgery.I worked with the doctor to get checked over - blood checks, urine, chest x-ray, ECG etc etc. He walked me through all of the results and said I was fine. He prescribed atenolol and said to take it if my BP was high, but that I could choose not to if I resolved the fear / anxiety issue. He basically said that he could not get an accurate reading and because the readings he did have were high, he had to prescribe.I became a little obsessed with taking my BP, taking it 20 or more times a day. Every time I did it I would have an adrenaline rush and my BP would be high - I was wired on adrenaline from the fear of my own blood pressure machine, which will obviously increase your blood pressure over time!! So I decided to take my BP far less regularly, once every few weeks. I lost a little weight, exercised even more often. Now 5 years later, I take my BP every couple of months. I take it 3 times with 5 minute intervals. It normally looks like this 1st time 145/85 HR 115, 2nd time 135/80 HR 75, 3rd time 130/75 HR 60 and if I take it again it will keep going down a little. Last time I took it I was 122/73 HR 58.I've kept a log over the years and my average even with all of the highs is 136/84 HR 82. If I take the adrenaline caused spikes out, then I am in the mid 120s and 70s. I do take a quarter dose of 12.5mg of Atenolol a day (although my wife says I don't need to) and even with this, my heart rate will spike at 115-120 the first time I take my BP.What I have learnt is that if you have an inquisitive / restless mind (like I do) you can imagine all sorts of negative things. However the data I have collected indicates that I have a phobia (which is what the fear of having your BP taken, or potentially the result, actually is). If you have a phobia of having your BP taken then it is likely your BP wil be high when you are exposed to the subject causing your phobia. Imagine taking someone who had a spider phobia BP just after you had shoved a tarantula in their face!!The problem I see here is that when you go to the doctors or for a medical procedure they don't always understand. I've had nothing wrong with me and have not been to the Doctors at all in the last 5 years (except to register as I have moved country - and they did not take my BP!). I need to deal with that one at some point :-) I am hoping I wil have an understanding doctor, and I will show them my spreadsheet!",

I am 28 and when i was 20 I had my BP done and it was 160/ ? and every time they went to do it i could feel my heart beat rapidly speed up EVERY TIME. So I got sent to my GP to have regular BP checks and the lowest they got was 130 but said that was still high.Recently I had another check and it was 160 then 150. I have just ordered a BP machine to take it at home myself as I do think it is just White Coat anxiety and would like to see what it is when i do it myself.The worst thing is for the past week since that BP check I have had bad anxiety. My heart feels like it is aching from the adrenaline and feel like every 5 seconds there is a surge of adrenaline\u00a0\u00a0which cant be good for me???? I just wish it would go away but i dont know\u00a0\u00a0how unless i go to the\u00a0\u00a0doc and get sedatives or something for anxiety?! argh hate this.",

            "answer": "Try Magnesium glycinate for anxiety, also for\u00a0\u00a0sound sleep and relaxed heart . If you take it as the bottle says, it will help control fear of the unknown, ie phobias. It will help hundreds of other health issue, including\u00a0\u00a0what you have posted here, and your fear of BP check. Take Mg half hour before you go for BP check, it will get you all relaxed, no worries. .Search more on Magnesium. It is a mineral we all need but Its no longer in our food as the food supply has changed.My family is on Mg, more so than calcium. As we know, Calcium is present in most foods that we eat, but Mg is not thats why supplementation is almost always necessary.Mg is the relaxation mineral. Calcium is the contraction mineral. This is how it works for the heart.Gwyneth Paltrow uses it for sleep as she talked about her health habits\u00a0\u00a0on Dr. Oz..Its the healthy choice for relieving anxiety, your body needs it and it will help for over all health; no sedatives please.No meds for anxiety please, just take your minerals.. :)Take care, I know this will help I know as I use it everyday.",

I could feel myself getting all worked up almost to the point of trembling/nervous.She took it and sure as eggs are eggs it was high, 160 over god knows what ( I didn't even see ), of course the nurse said yes your right it is high.I then told her I had been in hospital some months previously with Kidney stones and fever etc and that in hospital my BP and heart rate was high, although it did come down somewhat in hospital and they never addressed it, they did however do 2 ECG's there though but didn't say anything was wrong.Back to the Dr's/nurses office, she said she wants me back in a week to do bloods for testing for everything and\u00a0\u00a024 Hr BP monitor and urine sample. Well, for the next 7 days I am worrying all the time about the 24hr BP thing - \"it will be high all the time, I do a strenuous job so it will always be high \" I'm thinking to myself all the time.So the next feel I go to the nurse, she takes my blood and of course the dreaded BP, to which she said the BP had come down from last week, still high but not as bad. When I asked about the 24 BP monitor she said\"oh were not doing that today \", I explained that I didn't think it would work anyway and she is now happy for me to do home readings on my machine.She then took my pulse which was also high at 140, but she could see I was very anxois, she then did an ECG, took it to a DR in next room to look at and the result was OK but fast. My blood results came back a few days ago and all is good except for trace blood in urine sample ( could be to do with my kidney stones ) and to bring in another sample in 2 weeks. I have bought my own blood dipstick test kit yesterday and it read neutral !.Over the past week or so my home BP reading have been between as low as 120/77 and as high as 141/94 with my pulse being between 85 and 105.Although my 1st BP reading at home is usually high, it takes a few repeated rested readings to get it lower.I am at my wits end with worry here, what do you think they will do when I give them my BP readings ?.I don't mind just taking meds from the GP but hate the thought of having to go to hospital for tests etc.",

I also listen to the music while doing my Physical Therapy exercises \u2026 it is like doing yoga including the way I breathe. I strongly suggest to anyone who has lost hope of getting over the 'white coat' syndrome that we call when you go to the doctor and your BP soars, the best antidote for the white coat fear isto practice breathing while listening to the music and monitoring one's own BP on a home machine. My doctor accepted my 2-week BP readings that showed normal range in my BP taken twice daily. I found out about this wonderful program from Debbie on this website, she suggested BreatheEasy, vouching that it had helped her.

I had gone to the doctor...first time in years...and was nervous (because doctors make me nervous), my heart was pounding and they took my bp. It was 190/104 and pulse was 120! The nurse said I've got to go tell the doctor and ran out of the room! She returned immediately with a pink pill (clonidine) which I took. Meanwhile, the doctor came in and said I need to find out why your blood pressure is so high. My heart was still pounding and I was very scared. She sent me next door to have an EKG done. My heart was racing but the EKG was normal. I have suffered from anxiety off and on for years...I sometimes have panic attacks, which are severe. Now I'm on blood pressure meds and am supposed to be monitoring my readings everyday before my next doctor appointment. Alas, I have developed an intense fear of checking my blood pressure. I have managed to take a few readings...they were under 140/90...but one reading was 162/95 and it scared the crap out of me and ever since I cant bring myself to check it. Im also terrified of my up and coming doc apt. because I know they're going to check my blood pressure. I'm taking clonidine .1mg twice every 12 hours. This has caused me depression and anxiety for the past few weeks and its affecting my life! I don't know what I'm going to do. Thanks for listening.",

            "answer": "I am so glad i have found this site,everything i have read on here i can relate to,my bp problem started when i had my first daughter,every time\u00a0\u00a0i went for my antenatel check my bloodpressure would be slightly raised,but the way the doctors and nurses spoke to me made me feel like it was something really serious this in turn made me really really anxious everytime i went for a check up and with time my bloodpressure would go from being slightly raised to very high,,viscious circle.After my daughter was born i had to have mt bloodpressure checked regularly and of course because the seed had been planted it was always high.eighteen months later i got pregnant again i was really happy to be having another baby but then the fear kicked in about the antenatel checks and the bloodpressure going up,i tries on numerous occassions to exsplan it was because i was so anxious but it didn't make any difference still had the omg comments from the medical proffession.After i had my 2nd daughter i was\u00a0\u00a0left alone for a while,i then started having panick attacks and general anxiety disorder and was quite poorely with it,inthe back of my mind during all this what really sticks in my mmiind is bloodpressure checks i don't know if this caused my anxiety and panic but i'm sure it didn't help,i went for a routine doctors appointment oneday ans shhe said oh i will take your bp its not been taken for a while,i felt really really sick when she mmentioned aking my bp i told her oit would be really high because i always got really really anxious visting doctors annd having bloodpressure taken and that it would be really high cos iit always had been inthe past,she had a look into my medical records and said no your bllodpressure was ok really,but the day she took it cos of all the severe anxiety i felt it was sky high.I then had to book an appointment with the nurse for a repeat test,has you can imagine when it was\u00a0\u00a0checked cos of my bp phobia it was\u00a0\u00a0sky high,i now have a really good nurse and we had a good chat and i exsplaine my bp fears with her and she under stood,she advised me to get a bhome bloodpressure monitor and record my readings at home,then to take my readings to her when i had taken then at home and we would take it from there,the outcome was when i took my readings at home they were wiithin the normal range,she checked my machine was\u00a0\u00a0giving accurate readinds by checking it with hers it was,she exsplained about white coat syndrome annd said thats what i have and its a recogniised condition i goo and see her every 6 mnths with my home readings and my machine so she can check its accurate,upto now it has been,she said my readings at home are normal so not to worry i go twice a year to see her annd evenn weeks\u00a0\u00a0before my appointments due i get really worked up,i really wiish i could control this fear but as of yet i can't,i think its the bp phobia thats caused the anxiety and fear",

            "answer": "Hi, I only found this site a couple of days ago. It has been such a relief to see that so many people have this phobia about having their bp taken, and even when doing it theirselves at home. I am exactly the same.\u00a0\u00a0I had a very traumatic experience 3 days ago at my doctors . Three days before this my bp had been 107 /71. I went for a flu jab and the nurse said she would take my blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0She said you can refuse if you like. Even though I know its high when I have it done at the doctors, I stupidly agreed to have it done. Oh my god !\u00a0\u00a0Did I regret it. It shot up to 220 over 115, she kept doing it over and but it either went up higher or down a point or two. They wouldnt let me leave. They took me into another room and had the receptionist sit with me as they thought this would calm me down. It had\u00a0\u00a0no effect whatsoever as I knew it wouldn't. After about an hour I had to go in and see the doctor. She immediately wrote me a prescription\u00a0\u00a0for bp meds. Wants me to go back on anti depressants,\u00a0\u00a0( I have been on them within the last year)\u00a0\u00a0but I dont feel depressed anymore. She also wants me to see a councilor. Anyway, I really didnt want to go on bp meds, especially the one she was giving me. I couldnt find anyone who said anything good about it. I decided to take my mukta vati\u00a0\u00a0tablets that I took last year when my bp went up due to stress. I took 2 when i got home from the doctors, about 6pm. Then 2 more at 10pm. Took 2 at 6am the next morning. I have my own bp monitor and took my bp about 9 am.\u00a0\u00a0Iwas getting average readings of 158/83 so my bp had come down a lot since the docs the evening before.\u00a0\u00a0I took 2 more lots of 2 tablets that day.. To day I took 2 tabs about 7am. Took bp about 10 am and\u00a0\u00a0it was now averaging 145/77. Took another 2 tablets at 12 midday. By 3pm my bp was averaging 132/73\u00a0\u00a0and even had some in the 120's over 68. It is such a relief. I will keep taking them now and monitor every day for a while. They definately always work. I buy the Divya Mukta Varti, you can buy it on Amazon or just google it. Some of you may have heard of it already but more people with this awful problem need to know about it. It really helps with the phobia, because even though you feel stressed when taking your bp, it gradually lowers it anyway. It may take a few days longer to work with so e people but persevere because it does work.",

Sometimes with panic attacks.I also developed the bp phobia, and only this week had a traumatic experience at the doctors. The thing is, there is a way out of this. Maybe youve heard of Mukta Vati by now, it lowers bp amazingly and fast. Ive brought mine back down again in a few days. Even so, when I first sit down to take it I get the phobia, pounding heart etc. But even with that the first readings are not bad at all.\u00a0\u00a0Then I start to relax because of that and it comes down further. Are you in USA ?\u00a0\u00a0 if so I see they are sold on Amazon. I have recently got some on ebay here in the UK. Hope this will be of help to you.",

            "answer": "Thanks I'll try and remember these tips.I had a really bad panic attack at the dentist/Surgeons office yesterday 11-04-15 right about the time they told me they were going to take my Bp.The nurse told me as she was placing the cuff on me that it would probably be a little high. I went on to tell her I had White Coat syndrome and I knew it would be high. She looked really concerned as she said it was 180/115. Wow, that's the highest. She gave me water and I told her I would be outside getting some air. It was horrible. I came back inside and I didn't hear anything the gentle speaking surgeon said about extracting my cracked crown/tooth. All I heard was \"cadaver bone graft\" for my future tooth implant.When it was time to talk about the payment and setting up a date. I felt the pounding of my blood pressure and could not step in that small sized office space (small pantry closet size)Again, I told them I would be outside getting air. I grabbed a Coke on my way out. Called my wife and told her I loved her. Explained what happened, she reminded me to breathe. She left work to come be with me. I told her not too I would be fine. She works in another town.Walked back in to the front desk gave them y credit card for the visit. Walked back just to hand them my credit card and walked out. 5-10 min later walked back in and told them it wasn't a good time for me. I would call them tomorrow. Signed the receipt, grabbed the estimate and left.I walked to the near by water fountain to listen to the sound as I prayed to God to stay near me.I prayed, I self talked, the soothing voice from my wife helped but I still felt scared something bad (stroke) or something was going to happen.Drove to a nearby 7-11 and bought some baby asprin took two and drove home.My wife came home early rubbed my shoulders and I went to bed. She massaged my back until I went to sleep.She told me the next day (today) when she came home I looked pale white.I think it's a combination of things that triggered that horrible panic attack. Loss of sleep, stressed out due to finials at school and trying to keep up at my older age. Dehydrated from energy drinks I drank the day before during my studies.I feel embarrassed that I couldn't snapped out. It didn't matter what I told myself. I knew it was only a consultation appt. My wife says not to be embarrassed. I am not the only one that has had a panic attack in their office.This only seems to happen when it comes to my Bp being taken which is at my doctors office. Only this time it happened somewhere else and it felt way more Intense.Classes are over and I will be staying away from the drinks (energy) as well.",

It's also a pedometer...I've compared the results with a medical machine and the results are accurate.When you read comments about this product on internet, you will see that some people are happy and some people are disappointed\u2026If you use this wristband, check the results with a real medical machine (you can ask a friend to do it for you).I don't work for the brand \"Riversong\", I just hope that this information will help you\u2026Good luck.",

            "answer": "My dear God. I'm not alone. I thought this was something my mom passed me. She also had higher than usual BP when going to the doctor, but I can see that a lot of people suffer from it. In fact, I'm pretty sure I don't suffer from very high BP. Is just plain and simple anxiety. I'm 51, and the last time I went to the cardiologist, my BP was 160/90, and HR was around 140. The doctor prescribed Diovan 320mg, and asked me to keep measuring my HR, and advice him if it came lower. Just walking out of the hospital, it went down to 90, and at home, it was steady around 75.A couple weeks later, I started feeling weird, lacking strength, feeling feverish, not even been able to touch my wife. I called the doctor, and told me to go down to Diovan 160mg. I felt better the next day. It's been 6 months since, and I haven't had the courage to measure my BP again. I plan to get the wrist machine, and see if I can manage to reduce the anxiety and measure it, at least a couple times a week.But that's not all I've done for my health. I reduced salt consumption to a minimum, cut egg intake in half, I eat salmon 3-4 times a week, no pork, less bread, zero rice, breakfast is 1 boiled egg and a cup of cereal with some fruit and liquid yogurt, lunch is broiled chicken, or a piece of stake (no salt), salad and sometimes lentils or beans, and jello. Dinner is usually a big plate of salad with only olive oil, sometimes avocado and zucchini, and a piece of either salmon or chicken breast, with a few drops of olive oil in a hot dry pan. And a couple apples. That's all. I also walk fast for an hour 3-4 times a week.I also eliminated sodas completely, I only drink water and wine ;) I also eat raw carrots or apples for afternoon snack, or peanuts and almonds.I had a blood test a few weeks before going to the doctor last December, and my cholesterol was a bit higher than the normal level, but just a tad bit. I imagine that by now it should be normalized, with the dieting I'm doing. Tryglicerides were about normal.So, as I said, my plan is to get the wrist machine, and have another set of blood tests on October or November, and go visit my doctor again the first week of December.Now I know that my fear is real, and is the main cause of my higher than usual BP, since I don't have any symptoms whatsoever. No head aches, no nothing. My only symptoms started once I started taking the Diovan, and I've read it does get side effects, like increased sensitivity to heat. And sadly I live in a very hot country, so the weather doesn't help. That could be another cause of what I feel.I was particularly relieved when I read nurse Greenlydia post about relaxing and stop reading \"10 ways to die from high BP\".In fact since I had my BP taken at work last year, and it was obviously high, there is a record of that in my file, so next week there is a \"High BP awareness workshop\" and there will be a nutritionist and a doctor there, and I was \"required\" to attend. But I plan not to, one because it freaks me out, and I know they will measure everyone's BP. And secondly, because I don't need to read about how bad high BP is to your health, and what can happen to you if you don't take care of it. I KNOW is bad, for Christ's sake, and that's why I went to the doctor, that is why I'm dieting, and why I'm exercising. I don't mind the lecture about nutrition, but I'm sure I can find the same information on a google search.Anyway, thanks again for this thread. It really made me feel good, supported and understood. I'm not alone. Yipeeee!!!! Love you guys and gals.",

    "question": "I know I am not the only one who absolutely freaks out when having my blood pressure taken.\u00a0\u00a0Every time I go to the Dr's office, they always comment on how high my pulse and blood pressure are (last week when I went it was 127/92 and pulse of 133!)\u00a0\u00a0Ha...and those numbers arent even unusual for me!\u00a0\u00a0I know the pulse is high, but I don't worry about it as much just because I take it frequently at home now, and know that it is usually in the 80's when I'm at home.\u00a0\u00a0But the blood pressure...ugh!\u00a0\u00a0I am just convinced that I am going to have a really high reading sometime and that I'm going to just kill over.\u00a0\u00a0And the docs and nurses make it worse by always saying \"well, your numbers are a little too high for your age, even though you are nervous\" (I just turned 30).So...has anyone successfully conquered their fear of having their blood pressure taken?\u00a0\u00a0How did you do it?\u00a0\u00a0I really want to get over this. I mean, I feel like i try to do everything right...I eat fairly well, I'm definitely not overweight, dont smoke or drink, somewhat active...the only thing I have trouble with is my anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0Ugh...this is frustrating!",
