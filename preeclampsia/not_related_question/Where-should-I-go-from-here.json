If not, adrenal fatigue is probably not an issue for you..Your vitamin D and ferritin certainly need improvement, even though they are \"in range\"... wow... just a bit lower on each and you'd be deficient... most of us need to be relatively high in those ranges... I'd suggest that you supplement both vitamin D (typically, 2000 IU/day is safe) and iron.\u00a0\u00a0Ferritin is the hormone that indicates iron stores.. your ferritin is low in the range, which indicates that your iron may also be low.\u00a0\u00a0Iron is essential for metabolizing thyroid hormones.Your B12 isn't \"bad\", but if my level gets that low, I don't function well; you\u00a0\u00a0might want to supplement that, as well - sublingual or liquid is best.Your FT3, also is just above mid range, so that could stand to come up as well... Do you think there's any chance your doctor might consider decreasing your T4 med and adding a small dose of T3?\u00a0\u00a0 Every time you increase T4 med, it drives up your FT4, but if you don't convert properly, your FT3 won't follow suit..",

            "answer": "I had been taking 2500mcg of sublingual B12 in the morning and then also at night (5000). It helped but I went cold turkey for 6 weeks and my brain fog and fatigue got worse, I got vertigo, and light headed. My regular doctor ran blood, and my B12 was HIGH at 1115 with a 211-946 range.After the blood test I went home and took the B12 again, as well as iron and B6, and I started to feel like my old self again. Not great, but at least I wasn't laying face down on the floor anymore.That was the test that showed that I had a TSH of 13.34. Since I felt better taking the B12, I continued, but since it was previously elevated, they tested for it again, which of course was >2500 because I took a sublingual the night before. I stopped on 8/5 because I was to be tested again, and the result was 674.I currently have B12 2500mcg and Iron 65mg in my cabinet, should I just one each along with my daily vitamin?As for your poop list, he doesn't test for Free T3 either. They like to send me home with the order form pre selected, and I bring it back with that checked and circled in the closest matching pen that I have. =) I don't know what he'd say if I requested possibly giving me a dose of T3. Especially since he technically doesn't test for that, and my records show that they're in range. He was pretty willing to increase my Synthroid dose to 88 though without any issue. Those T3 pills sound like a big pain, from what I've read. Do you think that could really be an issue? Usually the people taking them are much lower than mid range.",

In 2000, I once slept 16 hours, being woken up though for various reasons.Anyway, I guess what I am saying is that I think I might've been hypo for quite some time before finally being diagnosed.

            "answer": "Vitamin D should be about 50-70; ferritin should be around 70, but you have to be careful with iron, because it does build in your system and too much is just as bad as not enough.Fortunately, vitamin B12 is water soluble and high levels aren't toxic; you just pee them out.\u00a0\u00a0You don't need to take 7000 mcg/day of it; since you pee out excess, it's really a waste.\u00a0\u00a0It's pretty obvious that since your levels drop quickly when you stop taking it, that you do need it.\u00a0\u00a0What about your diet?\u00a0\u00a0Best sources of Vitamin B12 are meat (particularly, red meat), dairy and eggs.Really?\u00a0\u00a0You check the FT3 and your doctor doesn't notice???\u00a0\u00a0LOL\u00a0\u00a0I did that one time on my lab sheet, but my end, typically, checks it; I think it was just an oversight.. He saw the result, because we discussed it, but he didn't say anything.Okay - now your doctor is really on my poop list... Have you actually \"talked\" to him about testing FT3?\u00a0\u00a0If so, what did he say?The symptoms you listed are all those of being hypo.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, the adrenals will kick in to take up the slack when the thyroid fails, but usually, once you start on med, your body re-adjusts and everything starts working as it should.\u00a0\u00a0While you might have had symptoms for quite a few years, it would appear that your thyroid had not completely stopped producing hormones.\u00a0\u00a0It's not unusual for symptoms to precede low labs, as hormone production declines.\u00a0\u00a0You can be hypo and still be producing thyroid hormones - just not enough to feel well.\u00a0\u00a0It often takes many years for the thyroid to completely burn out, so it produces nothing -- my endo told me, at my visit in Aug, that he can no longer feel my thyroid, which indicates that it's finally given up the ghost.I don't see adrenal insufficiency as your problem.I see your problem as a lack of conversion of FT4 to FT3.\u00a0\u00a0If you keep increasing T4 med, you will drive up your FT4, but there's a good chance that your FT3 won't follow suit.\u00a0\u00a0I think a very small dose of T3 med would be enough to bring your level up and feel better.",

            "answer": "My last blood test is 11 weeks away in December. Last one was 6 weeks, as was each other when it was finally diagnosed. I don't understand why he would request a December appointment, even if my TSH was 1.88 because with Hashi's, how do we know its stable yet? Especially since he increased my meds. I could go hyper possibly. And unless I end up in the ER, I probably will continue taking it until he says otherwise. If he thinks its something else, why would he want to put off treatment for possible depression?Also, he only tested for b12, D3, and ferritin because on my initial visit I brought him a folder full of previous lab work, and had previous deficiencies in those, with the exception of the B12 since it was high. He did not circle those labs this time. Which means that if FreeT3 was overlooked this time, with only two things being tested he's sure to notice the FreeT3.I never asked about testing for FT3 because I'm too shy. This was my second visit with him. The first one I assumed he would but noticed that wasn't checked, so I added it. The other previous FT3 test was only added because I asked the nurse of my primary care to order the test, bypassing the doctor completely. He was only going to order a regular thyroid panel, which did not include FT3 or FT4, and also ordered B12, since it was so high before. I added the antibody tests too on that visit.As for the B12, I started supplementing when I got brain fog. I started with 500mcg pills then went with sublingual. As the years went on, I increased as I got worse. After realizing I was taking 2 in the morning and 2 at night (2000mcg total) I went for the big one (2500mcg). But when I ended up taking one in the morning and one at night (5000mcg total) and still feeling blah, I quit all together, and finally got tested after 6 weeks of stopping. If you're supposed to pee out excess, why was it so high when I was finally diagnosed hypo? So it didn't \"drop quickly\" then. And recently, with the latest result, if it \"dropped quickly,\" then shouldn't that just mean that my body actually finally decided to pee out the excess? As for my diet, we are pretty carnivorous here, so that shouldn't be a problem.\"It often takes many years for the thyroid to completely burn out,\"I hear this, but about how many exactly? 5? 10? 20? I know that there are cases where it may only take a couple of months, but if it took 10-15 years of symptoms to finally get a high enough TSH, how much longer donI have to go?Not really related, but since its genetic, I had my mom get tested. She's hypo too. Haven't been tested for antibodies yet though. They were supposed to email her the results, but haven't yet. So she called up her brothers to make them get tested. Turns out, one of the two has Hashi's and didn't tell anyone!",

            "answer": "Maybe you should just go ahead with the testing that your doctor ordered next time, then when you meet with him, just ask if he will do FT3 on the next set of blood work and see what he says.\u00a0\u00a0If he refuses, you might want to look for another doctor?Typically, when our meds are being actively adjusted, testing is advised every 6 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Once levels become stable, most doctors will drop the testing to 12 weeks for a while, then on down to 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0Evidently, your doctor is much more confident that your levels are going to be adequate for 12 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I did mention that he's on my poop list, didn't I?\u00a0\u00a0LOL\u00a0\u00a0Here's one more reason.You stopped taking the B12 on 8/5 and had your next test on 9/16; is that correct?\u00a0\u00a0That would be approximately 6 weeks, which is not very long for your B12 to drop from > 2500 to 674. When you're taking huge amounts, it does take time for your system to filter it out; if you had checked your levels multiple times during that period, I'm sure you'd have seen a steady decline in your levels.\"Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water. After the body uses these vitamins, leftover amounts leave the body through the urine.\"\u00a0\u00a0National Institute of HealthGood that you're carnivorous... vitamin B12 is found only in animal products. It would appear that you possibly have some difficulty absorbing it through your stomach, but you seem to do okay with the sublingual.What happens with Hashimoto's is that the antibodies begin destroying the thyroid, but your thyroid is still producing hormones, even while the destruction is in progress.\u00a0\u00a0As time goes on, and more healthy thyroid tissue is destroyed, you thyroid production will diminish, but your thyroid is still producing some.\u00a0\u00a0You might not produce enough hormones to feel good, but you're still producing enough to keep blood levels at a \"normal\" level.\u00a0\u00a0 I believe that it took at least 30 years for my thyroid to stop producing enough to cause my TSH to go up to 55+, but my FT3 never did go completely out of range and FT4 was only barely out of range, so even then my thyroid was still producing something, just not enough.My symptoms have been alleviated and my levels have been stabilized on the same dosage for a couple of years, so we've pretty much figured that my thyroid is completely \"dead\", meaning I am totally dependent on my meds now.It's impossible to even guess at how much longer it will be before your thyroid burns completely out.\u00a0\u00a0If the destruction of my thyroid actually started when I think it might have, it's taken me almost 40 years to get to this point. Of course, I don't wish that on anyone, so hopefully, your will go more quickly.\u00a0\u00a0I think it's pretty rare for it to only take a couple of months.",

Should I start a new thread? My doctor referred me to this guy. I knew something was up, when I read the building name as being \"North Texas Diabetes and Endocrinology\" I'm not against having someone like that treat me, it's just that from what I read, some seem to know more about that area, than the other. Their site states that they treat thyroid patients.He said that my current levels were around the same as his, and yet he doesn't have symptoms. (Because we all know what works for one person will work for everybody else) This was when he started talking about antidepressants.\"Good that you're carnivorous... vitamin B12 is found only in animal products.

Seems odd that sublingual isn't a problem though. As I said, we're pretty carnivorous here. There's meat in just about everything I eat. Pretty much can't avoid it. But during the time I wasn't supplementing I had huge cravings for salmon. Specifically salmon rolls (sushi). I finally got to have some 2 days before my blood test. I was worried that this might effect the results as salmon has a TON of B12 in it. Yet even after eating this, after 2 days, that's what was in my system.",

Shame on your doctor for making that comparison...Sublingual meds/vitamins enter the blood stream, directly, via tissues under the tongue, so they bypass the stomach, which is where we normally would absorb B12.\u00a0\u00a0It's possible that you may end up with PA at some point, but, typically, if other forms of administration work (i.e sublingual), you're good to go... I do have PA and the only way I can keep my levels up is via injection.\u00a0\u00a0 Typical injection interval is monthly; however, I do\u00a0\u00a0mine weekly, in order to keep levels adequate and I eat a lot of meat, fish, chicken, eggs, dairy, etc... my body just doesn't absorb it; nor does sublingual work for me, so I inject directly into my muscles.",
