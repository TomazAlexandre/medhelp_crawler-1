I am now 30 weeks and for the past few days (since Thursday) I have had severe headaches, pain in my upper abdomen, I have been feeling like my heart is going to jump out of my chest and sleeping alot more than normal. My face and hands have also been getting more swolen. I was looking through my What to Expect when your Expecting and online and have got the same response. Pregnancy Induced Hypertynsion.
