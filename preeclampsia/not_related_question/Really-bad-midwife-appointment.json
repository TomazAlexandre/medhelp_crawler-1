            "answer": "I'm so sorry you had to go through that!!! My doctor would tell me at every appointment that I gained too much weight.\u00a0\u00a0He told me I am only supposed to gain 1/2lb a week until end of 1st trimester, then 1lb/week after that.\u00a0\u00a0Well I was going for my monthly check ups and gained 5 - 8lbs.\u00a0\u00a0He would just walk in and say \"gained more weight again\".\u00a0\u00a0Finally I just said, \"look, besides the fact that I'm PREGNANT I don't know why I'm gaining the weight because I am eating the same as I was before I was pregnant\".\u00a0\u00a0Every appointment after that, he never mentioned any issues on my weight, except for the time I gained 6lbs in one week during my last month of pregnancy - but that was out of concern because I was swelling really bad and ended up having mild preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0You after I had my daughter I told myself I would exercise as soon as I got clearance - but it's exhausting being a mother to an infant!! Even though she lets me sleep through the night (5-6 hours) I really don't have time to relax.\u00a0\u00a0So they need to cut you some slack!\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad you did say something though - they need to be aware of people like that.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, my nurse would just weigh me and do whatever other measurements the doc needed, then my doctor would review everything with me.\u00a0\u00a0Also, sometimes you gain weight no matter how healthy you are or how much excersizing you do.\u00a0\u00a0My mom exercised everyday and ate healthy when she was pregnant with me, and gained 50lbs.\u00a0\u00a0They need to understand that sometimes you are just prone to gaining weight.",

            "answer": "Oh your poor dear!!! Sorry you had an awful experience. I hope you are able to see someone else or go to another clinic. I hate it when nurses/docs/midwives think they have the right to treat you any old way they want.As for the weight issue, you are at higher risk for complications such as gestational diabetes and you have a higher risk of having a c-section (doesn't mean you WILL but you have a higher chance). I know this because I am also overweight. Depending on the midwife, some of them cannot see what may become high risk patient. It really just depends on the medical experience they got in school.But the nurse could've been more gentle with how she approached the issue of weight. Being a woman herself she should know better!",

            "answer": "the thing is it doesnt bother me that she said i ight have complications i understand that really i do, but given that i havent put on any weight yet, i only put on a couple pounds last time (i'll tell you my midwife was shocked lol), i've had a normal birth before and as i didn't have pre eclampsia or gestaional diabeties last time my other midwife said the liklehood (sp? im seriously on a spelling block at the moment) of having them this time is lower.I'm a book-a-holic i read everything i can. I know all the hazerds of being over weight and pregnant. I've reseached loads about home birthing (don't worry with a midwide). I spkoe to my old midwife (isn't facebook great?) and my doctor and they've said i should have a green light to have a home birth, and like my ex midwife said if i was that high risk they wouldn't even consider it.",

At least the blood nurse listened to me about where to get my blood. lol there one point in my body you can get a vein hehe.",

            "answer": "As far as I'm concerned i wouldn't go back there no matter how much you like your midwife. They have disregarded you and told you (by their actions) that you are unimportant. They can forget about you and it's not a big deal. The staff is rude and......POLICY?!!!!!! Since when are medical tests policy? It makes me wonder what other \"policies\" they have that disregard your health or questions. There is absolutely NO REASON to refuse you those tests! They can notify you that they won't be covered by insurance (if that is true) and tell you how much it will cost you, but what do they have to gain by instituting a policy to withhold medical tests? Heck, if you are willing to pay cash, you can go to a lab and get them done. They will not be covered by insurance unless a doctor orders them.Get another midwife at another clinic! If your current midwife asks tell her your experience and that you refuse to be treated this way by anyone. Let her know that she can thank her staff, their irresponsibility, and policies for you leaving.",

And although i was forgotten AGAIN. I'll just have to make sure that -if there's a next time- that i wont let them forget me. :)Thanks everyone x",

    "question": "Can you believe it?!?!?!I went for my first midwife appoinment yesterday i didn't see a midwife but a nurse - she was tending to a women in labour, which i was fine with - and they've changed the downs syndrome test they said it has to be done at the dating scan between 9 weeks and 13 weeks 5 days. But because they forgot me in the system AGAIN (3rd time) that i wasn't aloud the test because my date show me to be 15 weeks. So i said can i have the triple test between 16 weeks and 19 weeks like i did with my son (a year ago). She said thats not the policy any more. So i said (and i need to express that i was not at all shitey not abusive in anyway)\"Hang on its not my fault you forgot me again and i know it's not yours but i would like to be checked either way as it's too late for the new test the triple test will have to do.\"So she says\"It's not policy anymore, but as a one of for the fact that you was forgotten we'll make a exception.\"I'm sorry but i think thats quite bad. What if i just found out i was pregnant? I really think its bad that if your over the 13 weeks 5 day 'dead line' then you cant be tested. The worst thing is that with the downs syndrome test they test for spina bifida. Its the what if question really i dont care if the test came back as a high possiblity but its the preparing yourself if need be.AND THEN she weighed me, ok so know im over weight i ALWAYS have been and i lost 2 stone before i got pregnant with DS and i put on something like 3 pounds while pregnant because i knew it would be easier. And i've lost another stone since DS birth, I plan on doing the same this time round. So she says your VERY over weight i'll need to book you in with the consoltant as it may be dangerous for you to have a natural birth because i'll have a high chance of complications.So can you blame me i was getting ****** now coz then my mum walked in the room with my son who is nearly 7 month old and under weight at 14lb 14oz, and i said yeah amazing that i got through 9 months last time gave birth naturally without anyones help with out a epidural to a 7 pounder i know he was big wasn't he? She went red.OMG before i left i spoke to the the (dunno what theyh're called) manger? And said i would like it put down on my notes to not see that nurse again she asked why and i said i've never been so insulted in my life and let me tell you i've been insulted lotes of times. She was very upest by the nurse, but agreed.Ok i KNOW im over weight, obese, fat what ever you want to call it but i've worked SO HARD to lose weight and be the best mother i can.Im a great mother and i work hard on being with my son and making sure he isn't bored and we're very active. I walked 6 miles today how can anyone say im not trying sorry rant over had to get it of my chest.",
