            "answer": "Reposting for Amanda....I wasn't really young when I got married, I was 21, but not everyone agreed. My husband and went to the same place for our AIT (Army's job school). I used to go out to the bar on the weekends with my friends, but decided to go alone one night when they were at the hotel. A guy my husband was sitting with came up to me and asked me to join their table, and I agreed. My husband barely said a word to me that night, but I knew I had to see him again, I didn't know why and I couldn't explain it I just had to. So I looked for him everywhere I went and found him at the bar again, I stared at him ALL night, and I don't normally do that I'm very old fashioned, you know, guy asks the girl out, guy calls the girl, guy makes the first move....so I went outside to smoke, and he came out after, we talked for a few minutes and then he asked for my number, we talked every day after that. A couple weeks later I stayed at a hotel with my friend and he stayed at the same hotel with his friend. We woke up the next morning went to eat at a bagel place, my at the time boyfriend and I were looking at real estate magazines and he said \"we should just get married and buy one of these houses\" In the back of my head I was thinking \"that sounds like a good idea\". So later that day he told me he was kind of serious. Not too long after he sent an e-mail asking my parents if he could marry me, and soon after that we got married in a courthouse. Now...I was engaged to a guy for a year and a half before I joined the Army, I left him just after basic training, and met my husband a few weeks later. My husband and I had known each other almost three months, and dated just over two months before we got married. I think you can see where people didn't exactly agree, and you can imagine some of their replies when we told them two months later that I was pregnant. (We got the whole \"you could have told me when you got married\") BUT I got pregnant AFTER we got married. Anyways, my husband and I have been married for two and a half years next month. But I know my husband and I were meant to be. When I was engaged before my husband and I met, my ex and I picked a date...Sept 13, 2007. This was before I even thought of joining the Army...Guess what...that's the day I got married, because that's the day I graduated AIT, I knew I'd get married that day, I just didn't know to who. So that's my story. I wasn't that young, but people did disagree...BUT~~I wouldn't change it for the world!!!",

We had to pay $50 for the certificate/license, we got it the day we got married. The nice thing is the judge that was there doesn't normally do military weddings since a lot of them end in divorce, but she did ours! I was leaving for FL the next day, so I think that helped in her decision, or she just felt like we would make it! They even asked if what kind of vows we wanted, and googled wedding vows to find different types, we just used the regular old \"we are gathered here today, do you take this man/woman, you may now kiss the bride\"...we're also planning on having an actual ceremony one day, it's funny cause DS will probably be old enough to be our ring bearer.",

            "answer": "Thought I'd join in. For those of you who don't know, I have 2 healthy daughters ages 10 and 7. No complications what so ever. DH and I decided to try again after 7 yrs. I had been on BC for that long so 3 months of trying, we go pregnant. But on Jan 16th had a natural m/c at 4wks and 3 days. My ob/gyn said to wait a cycle but I wasn't too emotional and was ready to try again right away. If my body isn't ready right after than it won't let it happen. I did ovulate this cycle. I also ate yams. If you know the story behind it then you know why I ate them. Wanted to give myself any chance to ovulate. I did ovulate. I'm currently on 9DPO. On 6DPO I had cramping/pain/twinges of and on since. Last cycle I had the same thing at 6 DPO and I believe that's when implantation was. I mean I was able to get a + HPT at 11 DPO. So I'm hoping these cramps will result to the same thing(+ HPT). My bb's started tingling on top yesterday (8 DPO). I will probably test on Monday. I also go to see the high risk docs on Monday also for a consultation. Maybe I can convince them to do blood test. I will be considered high risk because I was diagnosed with a certain type of arthritis 3 yrs ago and they say I would be more at risk of having preeclampsia, kidney problems, gestational diabetes because I have to take prednisone instead of my normal arthritis med.(I'm a nurse also) I have not ever experienced any of these issues though. My OB just wants to take precautions which I don't mind.My husband and I have been together since I was 18 and he 17. We got married at 22 and 21.Have had our ups and downs but still going strong after being together twelve yrs and married for 8. And many people doubted us.Huge congrats to all the BFP's! Its so nice to see there is hope for a happy ending.Thanks for reading my chapter book. Lol",

            "answer": "OKay, I am not mad. i looked up online about the test, and this is what i found out. So maybe i am not out of the race.Because you want to know at the earliest possible time if you are pregnant or not I highly recommend getting the all white Equate brand from WalMart. They for some reason, changed their tests and it may be hard to find an all white one. If you see and Equate test that has a purple cap do not buy it!!! The new Equate with the purple cap measure 100mIU. If you can't find the Equate then I would suggest that you get one of the tests that measures 25mIU. The earliest that you can test is 12 days past ovulation and if you do not get what you think should be the correct result then test again 2 days later at 14 days past ovulation. If you have a 28 day cycle and are very regular then you most likely ovulate on day 14 or 15 of your cycle and can test as close as two days before your period is due. If your cycle is irregular then it is much harder to tell when or even if you ovulated. This is one of the reasons that I like charting so much. You know what is going on with your body.I took the one with the purple top. So god i hope this is correct",

Im playing for a miracle!!!Heatherm4- LOL, no we're not having a wedding until we have the money to have the big wedding that we want which probably wouldnt be for a couple years since we're trying to move out of Chicago this year.

It wasn't until the morning of my expected period that I used a FRER digital and it said yes+.\u00a0\u00a0I even took a test the afternoon of the 14th with a BFN and then the morning of the 15th BFP. So it is definitely possible to get a BFN and then a BFP.",

But that is a good idea, except I'm usually on top, and after a minute it gravity takes affect...what goes up must come down, and we've got black silk sheets! I'm usually pretty quick to roll over lay down, and prop up on a pillow.Ladies do you think it matters if the woman orgasms, are you more likely to get pregnant if you do? I've tried researching online and can't find anything on the topic at all. DH and I have toys that help me, I can't get one unless I use them while we're BDing, they're external toys so nothing goes in down there (aka Mary Rose, lol, faith too funny!). BTW what position do you ladies think works best? I'm usually on top, but should we be trying DH on top more or what?",

As for position I find mixed opinions whenever I search.Yesterday I tested at 11 DPO and got BFN. Today I tested and got very very faint line. Even DH could see it. The same thing happened last cycle when I m/c'd. I have internet cheapies so I will test often. I'm going to test tomorrow. If I see a line then I'm going to get a digital to confirm. I'm still having cramping/twinges off and on. I feel bloated. My nipples pertrude more than usual. Breast tingling at the top and they feel fuller. I mean I feel really snug up top. I've had more creamy cm than usual for this time in my cycle. The test said to read after 5 minutes. I read it at about 8/9 minutes. I did drop it on the floor when I went to pick it up and read it, so I don't know if that screwed up the results. I hope I'm really seeing what I'm seeing.",
