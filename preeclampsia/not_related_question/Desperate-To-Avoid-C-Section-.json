The general did not agree with me, I went into hypertension stage 3 and was in recovery for 6 hours. I wasn't even allowed to see my son.They left placenta in me and left me with a abscess the size of a tennis ball with a staph infection. The issues weren't rectified for months and i am absolutely petrified that something similar will happen this time.But, if doctors think its best my daughter is born at this gestation to avoid complications, I don't want to argue.I want her here healthy and safe :(",

However, despite her belief in vbacs, she told me it would be foolish and too risky to try vbac after 2 c-sections. I asked why. She said the risk of adhesion from scar tissue is too much, and there is a much greater risk of significant problems that would threaten both mom and baby. This potential is even greater if you have never delivered vaginally.I am a little surprised that they are doing it before 38 weeks. Have they tested for lung maturity or given you steroid shots as a precaution? Sometimes the baby's lungs aren't quite developed yet at that gestation.",

I don't believe that it has anything to do with the baby as I had the same reaction under a general 6 years ago.The anaesthetist basically told me it happens,spinals fail and that's that so we'll what happens.I don't like the idea of having another caesarean or the long recovery especially with an 18 month old but my main concern is avoiding a general.To go to sleep pregnant and wake hours later with your baby gone, vomiting blood and being in excruciating pain is not something I'd wish on any mother, and unfortunately this was my experience.I wasn't able to see my son for around 6 hours and the nurses in recovery wouldn't do so much as tell me where he was or if he was ok.It made the birth of my son one of the most horrific experiences of my life.I don't know where you guys are, I'm in Melbourne, Australia. We have some of the best hospitals in the world so it's upsetting that some of the doctors are so ignorant.The head midwife at the hospital\u00a0\u00a0told me that as the scans they performed of my uterus to inspect the scarring came back quite well, that should I go into labor naturally before the scheduled c-section date that they would do their best to allow me to deliver naturally providing that I understood that this would mean very close monitoring and that she would allow no 'grey area' eitherbubs is happy or not, no in between. She would perform a caesarean at the first sign of distress, which I completely agree with.This is why I'm hoping labor will start naturally. But, a caesar is looking inevitable :(",

Nothing is working :(Have any of you guys had success with other methods?I know that MANY readers will disapprove but please keep in mind, I am not making these attempts purely because I'm sick of being pregnant like many do, as I know that my daughter will be here by Thursday regardless., I am doing so to avoid having another 7 MONTH recovery from a c-section like I had with my son.So, please do not reply if you are going to be negative.Thanks :)",
