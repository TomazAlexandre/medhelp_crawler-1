I've been showing signs of labour now for 3 days but they keeps saying your not in labour unless you lose your plug or your waters break. My mum went into labour, didn't lose her plug and they had to break her waters for her. They don't ask any questions and when you tell them anything they just say thats normal. They don't check if your dialated or anything here either. They can't be bothered.\u00a0\u00a0They try get rid of you as quick as possible. I have an appointment today, I am 38 weeks. Will see what they say. Good luck with the castor oil. Hope it works. I've tryed everything and nothing has worked for me, I'm in agony xx",

    "question": "37 + 4 days so taking castor oil today can't deal with the contractions and the pain any longer and my gynae is an idiot. I call him to tell him I have itchy hands and feet for over 3 weeks it might be cholestasis a problem with my liver he suggests I go see my GP and he will decide if it should escalate to him. I'm thinking wtf cholestasis is a pregnancy related thing wtf his brain is on drugs I think. Whenever I see him for my checkup he says nothing asks no questions I have to ask all the questions he just examines me does the scan writes in my file and says you're good to go see me in 2 weeks. Wtf??? I was admitted 2 and a half weeks ago as I nearly went into labour and he stopped it he gave no explanation the nurse had to explain everything to me I'm a FTM I need to know these things. So fed up with doctors that just take your money and don't even do their job properly.",
