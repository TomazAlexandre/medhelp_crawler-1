    "question": "I am 32+4 and woke up this morning with a lot of swelling in my hands, feet, ankles and face. This is my second pregnancy and i have been lucky enough to never have to deal with this. I had to use oil to get my wedding rings off and up until this morning they have always been a lil bit big on me. Is it normal to swell up like this since i haven't been up or gotten over heated at all? My feet feel like I'm walking on fluid filled pillows and the skin on my hands feel so tight like my fingers are going to pop. Has anyone had this happen over night?",
