Tons of support groups out there with twins. even though you got rid of some of your stuff, start tag saling, ask friends, or buy new. i think that will also help you to feel some excitement during this unexpected time. best of luck to you and your family.",

I just have to tell you what an absolute, overwhelming happiness they have brought me and I truly believe as someone else has said that you are extremly blessed and that God obviously wants these guys for you. I was wondering if you had anything like those symptoms? Also just crying at the drop of a dime and feeling very moody??? Just don't know what to think. If you have any questions regarding the twins I would be happy to help. Take care and take it very easy and if I can give you any advice, eat alot, no matter what the doctor tells you, I was lucky to have seen a multiples specialist, and just read books on my own, one said eat and eat. I did and the babies were born at35 weeks and healthy as ever.",

I can usually focus pretty good and have pretty normal labors. We began our marriage wanting the average 2 children. Due to Providence, although we tried to stop the pregnancies they kept coming. We decided to have as many as would come our way and opened our hearts to that idea. We have many friends with large families. They are happy, beautiful and well-adjusted. Then this happened and the Doctors totally convinced us if we tried agian, myself and the baby would surely die....Well, in our vulnerable state we agreed to a tubligation. Once I recovered and did some research I found out many women have gone on to have heathy, safe labor and deliveries after these same complications. We seldom believe everything we are fed from teh medical field...this time we were vulnerable. Now we regret the decision. We have grieved much!! Reading this forum has given me hope that maybe, just maybe it is possible to still get pregnant. They cut and burned one side the other side they apparently just clamped...does it sound possible??Does anyone know of any doctor in Manitoba that is large family friendly??THat would give us positive advice in this situation??Please email me at ***@****.",

He said that due to the endometreosis on my tubes and overies I could get pregnant. he ran a pregnancy test due to how i was felling. I'm sure i'm not pregnant cause he never called to tell me so. If I was he would have called by now it has been 4 days. I ask do the silicone rings fail alot. He said they either come loose or off or endometreosis forms and then pregnancy can happen. he has seen quiet pregnany with silicone rings. We have pictures of mine that is so weird. i had surgery 8 yrs before and the rings was tight and fine. I can't say the same now. They are not tight and the tubes has grown over them.
