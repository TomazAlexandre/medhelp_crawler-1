            "answer": "Hi all - i have been taking 2 magnesium tablets 30 mins before bed time and it is amazing. It totally relaxes you and helps with the cramping. Magnesium is an amazing thing; they call it nature\u2019s natural tranquilizer.And if my hip pains are really bad I take 1 tablet again in the morning. I take the CAL-MAG mix, so that I get the best of both worlds and my doc is very happy that I am taking them.Trust me, it works\u2026. Some days, it at least takes the edge off of the pain, and other days it take it completely away.Give it a try. It is also so good for baby, and also helps prevent early labour.Read up on it \u2013 its amazing\u2026.and there is not enough in our pregnancy vitamins, so taking extra is needed.",
