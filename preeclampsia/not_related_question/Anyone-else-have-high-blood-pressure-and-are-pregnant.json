            "answer": "I have high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0It started at the end of my first child when I developed toxemia.\u00a0\u00a0I since then have taken bp meds.\u00a0\u00a0When I got pregnant with my next 2 which where girls at first I went of meds because my bp drop to normal. Then during the last trimester it went up and I was put on aldoment for my 2nd baby prescribed by my family Dr.\u00a0\u00a0This medicine is ok but will make you feel really tired and worn down.\u00a0\u00a0With may second daughter I believe they put me on atenolol.\u00a0\u00a0I was also put on a baby apsirin once a day.\u00a0\u00a0Dr said it was to help with pre-eclampsia that it wouldn't prevent it but it would help not to make it so severe.\u00a0\u00a0I was watched closely with my pregnancies.\u00a0\u00a0At about 28 and 30 weeks I had a Dr appt then starting at 32 weeks I went in every week.\u00a0\u00a0Dr did a NST and ultra sound. Which turned out to be a good then with my 2 daughter in one week I went from have 12 c of anmontic fluid to only 2.\u00a0\u00a0I went straight to the hospital to have her.\u00a0\u00a0With hbp your placenta gets old quicker.\u00a0\u00a0With both my daughters I went up until 3 days before due date.\u00a0\u00a0 With my last baby it got bad really bad.\u00a0\u00a0My Dr always had me check my bp at home at first about once a day then up to about 3 or 4 times.\u00a0\u00a0Well around my 26 weeks I told her that at home my bp was up around 169/92 and sometimes it got up to 176/110.\u00a0\u00a0But in the office when the medical assistance took my bp it was always 130/70.\u00a0\u00a0My Dr. didn't recheck my bp.\u00a0\u00a0I now wish that I insisted her to due so.\u00a0\u00a0Finally at 31 weeks my Dr had to be at the hospital so the Nurse Pactioner handle my visit.\u00a0\u00a0She came in after the MA did her thing and again my bp when she took it was 130/70, the first thing she noticed was my shoes and she ask is that a new look (my shoes were untied) I said no I cant tie my shoes my feet are so swollen.\u00a0\u00a0She took my bp it was 200/110.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0Over the next several I was sent back and forth to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0Until finally they keep me.\u00a0\u00a0Long story shorten.\u00a0\u00a04 days after being admitted I gave birth and I was on a vent and so was my baby.\u00a0\u00a0I had developed super imposed Preeclampsia,(my 24 hour urine was 1900 gms this was done twice in the hospital and once a week before they wanted to confirm the results) this was also causing my kidneys fail) pulmonary edema, Hellp syndrome, and Congestive Heart Failure. I don't tell you this to scare you but to share with you that it didn't have to get so bad for me only if my Bp had been controlled and if I had gotten the proper treatment earlier.\u00a0\u00a0I beat myself up a lot because I didn't make my Dr check my Bp.\u00a0\u00a0I knew the MA wasn't taking my bp correctly(there was one time I ask her what my bp was right after she had finished because before I came inside I took my bp in my car and I had like 158/92 she walked over to my chart and looked at it and said oh it is the same as it was last week) and when my Dr didn't due anything when I mentioned it I should have seek a different Dr.\u00a0\u00a0It is never to late to change Dr's when pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0OH Yeah ever since the time the NP took my bp just less then a 1/2 from the MA only a Nurse took my Bp when ever I went back for follow-ups after I got out of the hospital.",

He is seeing me every 2 wees right now. I'm o aldomet now. I can relate to the wiped out feeling. My pressures are behaving righ now, hope they hold out. I;m worried about work. I'm a HS teacher It isa high stres job and I'm afraid that it will elevate my pressures. Did you work? My last baby I got preeclasmia and was hospitalized. I to had the tests and was ganing mj wit in water every day. 3-5 ibs. I was induced when it got too out of control at 34 wks. My baby girl thankfully was just fine, no problem at all, went straight to the newborn nursery. She was small 4lbs 10 ozs. I was on atenol in the hospital too. Was in 7-9 days before I gave birth. Was on iv meds to prevent seisure. It is scary. SOunds like you went down fast the last time. I ck. my pressure twice daily. My nurse is very good. I will keep on top of it. So how long was your recovery? I'm so hoping to make it at least 30 wks. forthe baby's sake.",

            "answer": "Sorry to hear about your trials with your last. How awful! I do have great family support. I willjust have to gauge how I'm handling my stress load at work. I just keep telling myself one day at a time. So glad to hear your son is doing well! Yes that mag stuff is just so awful! What we go through for our kids! Thanks again for sharing your experience with me. I haen't heard much about this issue other than last trimester onset. My dr. thinks I was going to have high blood pressure eventually and that the pregnancy brought it on earlier than perhaps otherwise. My father has high blood pressure. He started having problems around 40 also. Guess it is an inherited thing.Thanks again!God Bless!:)",

He was 3lbs 14 ozs He had to recussated at birth, was septic, Dx with respirtary distress syndrome, he was jaundice, has reflux other little minor things but is really due well.Sounds like you are under good care and on top of things-you'll and your baby will be fine.\u00a0\u00a0My friend just had twins at 31 weeks and they are doing great.\u00a0\u00a0They were 4.6 and 4. 9 and only was in the NICU for 4 weeks.",

            "answer": "when i was pg w/ds i started taking aldomet about 9 or 10 weeks into the preg. i was not currently taking bp meds but hbp has always run in my family so i was not shocked. my dr started me out on very low dosage. as the preg progressed my meds had to be increased several times to maintain a normal bp. during this time i also worked a very stressful job. at the end of my 6th month or beginning of 7th month i was taken off work and the meds were increased at that time. after a week i had lost 14lbs., had very little swelling and my bp had dropped considerably so we were able to lower my daily dosage. at the end i think i was taking about 250mg. i realized i had to slow down, after i made myself realize this everything went pretty well. i was always so concerned about side effects on my baby but, he was completely healthy and has had no major medical problems. just do what you can to keep your bp low, take it easy and everything s/b just fine.",

            "answer": "My daughter had kawasaki's disease when she was 21 months old. She had the highest Sedimentation rate (the only way to check to make sure damage wasn't being done to heart, blood vessels, etc.) her doctors had ever seen with no obvious damage (i.e. aneurisms, etc.) In 1983, the hospital treated over 60 cases of kawasaki's disease - they called it an epedemic.She is now pregnant and her due date is 9/24/08. She had her weekly checkup yesterday and her doctor confirmed that the baby is the same size it was 3 weeks ago. Although she normally has very , very low blood pressure (low 60's over upper 70s, her blood pressure has risen considerably and she is puffing up in her hands, feet and lips. A friend who works for another OB said my daughter should be induced because even though her high blood pressure (130/87) does not put her in the stroke zone, it is stunting the baby's growth and poses potential problems for toxemia for my daughter. My daughter's doctor is very conservative, which I normally like, but I'm not sure is she's remembering that my daughter also had kawasaki's disease as an infant either.Does anyone know if there are any long-term problems associated with infantile Kawasaki's Disease and high blood pressure during pregnancy?Thanks for whatever information you can provide.",

    "question": "I'm 43 and pregnant, around 9-10 weeks. I have high blood pressure that I developed with my last pregnancy almost 2 yrs ago. My blood pressure was normal until around 7-8 month and then went high. I was put on bed rest, then hospitalization till the baby was born at 34 weeks. I was given blood pressure meds. also. When I found out I was pregnant this time.I was taking Diovan, they took me off that and now on aldomet. Blood pressure is ok while on the med. worried that later on it will climb higher, just hope it will behave till the baby can be born healthy. Anyway, anyone have/had this experience. What can I expect?",
