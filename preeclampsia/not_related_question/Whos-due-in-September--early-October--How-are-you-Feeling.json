            "answer": "I'm due Sep 28th with a little girl. I feel ok. I work full time so I'm exhausted, after work I run my houshold from my bed, I eat there, hang with the kids there, watch tv there, dictate chores from there and then dont check to see if they are done cause I'm too lazy to get up. I'm not very big, in the tummy anyway, but my butt is enormous! As are my arms, Ick. Had preeclampsia with my other 3 and blood pressures are creeping up and protien now in the urine, so here we go again, have the 24 hour urine test this week, love having a big thermos of pee in my fridge.I have not registered, but went to babies r us and cannot believe everything I need. I have not had a baby in 11 years and I have forgotten a lot, also nothing saved, so literally starting from scratch. Other then that, I'm excited and all seems to be going well with her.",

Nurse at the hospital yesterday didnt believe me at first till she couldnt find her heart beat. She put the doppler right under my ribs and there she was. Nurse was baffled. I laughed and said I told ya so. So yeah I thought the same thing I'm\u00a0\u00a0WAY too early for her to be that high up, but for some weird reason thats where she likes to hang out and my uterus is for some reason big enough to let her get that high. All I can do is get up and walk around stretch and Hope and pray she will move cause she puts me in bad pain from being under there.",
