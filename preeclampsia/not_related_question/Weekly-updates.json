            "answer": "I've been asking hubby to get the crib back in the crib setting (It's still in toddler bed from our first, who's now moved into a full size bed), and he just isn't doing it because I \"keep asking him to do too many things\" lol.I hung up the gender natural (and boy clothing that is suitable for a girl) a few weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0We never painted the room for our son (and honestly are glad we didn't) he's working on rubbing the paint off with his toys as he likes the sound it makes.Since this is our second we have all the stuff we need, we just need to clean up our son's toys (pack a few away to swap out for when he gets sick of his current ones), that way we can make room to set up the swing.13 weeks left (Well as of tomorrow)!\u00a0\u00a0I'm excited and hope it goes fast as were pretty busy between now and when were due.Do you plan to have another child?\u00a0\u00a0If you do you might not want to paint the room pink unless you have another bedroom for the next child, if you end up with a boy next time you might want to re-paint it, and re-painting it with a bunch of toys and other toddler furnature can be not all that easy.",

I am waiting to have a shower so I can get some more stuff for Naomi. I have another prenatal appointment tomorrow and then they go to every two weeks after that. I am hoping to get my last ultrasound the 21st I will find out for sure tomorrow. I guess we will see what happens.",

            "answer": "I almost have the nursery all painted... its taken a ridiculous amount of time but its almost there! Than I have to put up the mural on her wall behind her bed and actually buy the furniture. Ugh. DH said we should be buying the furniture within the next two weeks but I still can't decide which set I want! Its sad because I literally sold all of Aspen's nursery furniture 2 weeks before I found out I was pregnant. Very unlucky timing. Other than that I'm sure I'll be getting a lot of things that I need at my baby shower plus I have a retarded amount of girl clothing from when Aspen was a baby. My next appointment is in like 2 weeks and I have to do the glucose test. Gross. They kept trying to convince me that the formula for the drink has changed and that its not that bad anymore but I don't really trust it.",

We are attending a wedding this coming weekend and I'm a little excited but nervous about it....I like attention here and there but when you are pregnant and going to something like that, it feels like you are swarmed of belly rubbings and a million questions! LOLDH and I are going to be starting prenatal classes soon I think! I'm a little excited for those!Just had my check up yesterday and I've gained 20lbs!! Blah!! Baby is doing great!

It is okay though because Marley is my 3rd baby and I did have a shower for my boys and DH's family is buying the furniture. I did decide on the white furniture and I also asked DH about what if we want to have another baby he said we would sell Marley's stuff (if we have a boy) and buy him new stuff (except for the furniture depending on Marley's age at the time) and new stroller/furniture whatever the new baby would need. I did save a lot of Richie's clothes and blanket (yes most of them are blue) and I still need to go through and see what is suitable to use for her =)",

She has 10 weeks to flip her happy little self around. I have felt about 5 braxton hicks contractions in the past two days. They scared me a little at first and they hurt a lot worse than any period cramps which is what everyone said they would feel like. I have my glucose test, RH, and anemia tomorrow along with a tour of the hospital my OB delivers at. I cant wait for my shower though I have no idea when it will be but my mom has to get on the ball and do it soon.",

            "answer": "Ugh where should I begin.... I took my glucose test on Saturday, June 19th and passed it =0) On July 4th we had a lil scare because the baby wasn't moving so we ended up at the L&D, and as soon as they hooked me up he starting going crazy and kicked and moved all over, I really felt like an idiot since I didn't feel him move the whole day and when we got there he was moving, but the nurse said that she gets lots of expecting moms who's baby's do the same thing and that it's better to be safe than sorry =0) So then after that lil scare we went and pre-registered at the hospital on July 5th just in case something decides to come up, and boy am I happy that we did because at my 6th prenatal appt which was Tue. July 6th my blood pressure was 140/88 and it has been 120/70 throughout my whole entire pregnancy so now my Dr thinks that I am getting preeclampsia already which is super scary since I'm only 28 weeks and 4 days as of right now, so I had to be sent in on the 7th to go get my blood work done to see if I have preeclampsia and I wont know my results until Tue. July 13th which is my next Dr's appt, but I have a feeling deep down inside that I already have preeclampsia because my feet are super duper swollen and won't go down even with rest =0( I just really hope that I can make it to at least 37 weeks so my lil guy will be full term. I don't have anything ready for the nursery at all, and I'm freaking out about it the only thing we have is the paint color that is still sitting in the can. Not too sure if we are going to have a baby shower for this lil guy now either because my mom just got laid off, so far I'm having a really horrible week =0( But I do have some exciting news, tomorrow we're getting our 3D-4D ultrasound pics done so I'm super excited to see what my lil man looks like. Hope you ladies are having a better pregnancy than mine =0)",

            "answer": "So far so good I guess. Baby is moving more and more and it hurts sometimes. I noticed that I'm getting more discharge then I had been getting. I also told my OB that sometimes when that baby kicks feels like something is coming out. The discharge is yellow....I cant believe I didnt figure out it was urine. LOL My OB said its completely normal especially since its not my 1st pregnancy. BP at my appt was a little higher then its been the whole pregnancy and the dr said its probably because its hot outside (was 98 degrees yesterday) and I had the air on high yesterday in the car and was @ work all morning. So go figure. I also notice at night my heart seems to be racing so she ordered add'l blood work and another urine culture. I also had the glucose test which I passed with flying colors :D . Belly is mearsuring 28 wks even tho I'm 26 so thats great. Little Peri is so active I can't wait to meet her. My OB appts are now every two weeks, next appt 7/22.",

I am moving back in with my parents at the end of this month because my bf is joining the army and will be gone for training for 6 months (it really ***** and I am totally dreading it, he will be gone the last 2 months of my pregnancy and first 4 months with the baby!)I won't be painting or decorating since I won't be there too long, I'll just save that for when we move to our own house after he is done training.We just bought a bassinet the other day, so we are very slowly making some progress haha. My moms friend has some stuff for me so I don't want to buy anything until I see her stuff, sometime soon hopefully.My best friend is going to plan my shower which will be mid August so we really need to get on that lol. But its not going to be huge and nothing too formal so we won't be sending out invitations (probably just invite everyone through e-mail and speaking to them or something).I have a midwife appointment this week and then I start having my appointments every 2 weeks, thats exciting :)",

    "question": "So I figured since we are all either in our last trimester or are really really close that we should keep each other updated weekly on what is going on in our lives and with our rapidly growing babies!As for me still haven't started the nursery... I keep thinking about colors and it is so hard for me to decide. I don't know if I should go pink (the room is creme right now), teal, green and brown or what... It is going to be something that is matched with the colors in the bedding... I am just not sure which yet. My MIL called me today and I sent her an email with all of the information on our choice on the furniture since they are buying the nursery furniture for us. So that is out of the way. Still waiting on the reenlistment bonus for hubby to go on my major shopping spree =)Hope everyone is having a good week =)",
