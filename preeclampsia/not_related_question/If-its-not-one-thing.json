Even though they were small, they were as healthy as any other baby. Never had to go to special care nursery and got to go home on time. Your ob should follow you very closely though. I had 2 ultrasounds and 2 non stress tests every week towards the end. The goal is to get the baby to 38 weeks. Once my babies fell below the 10th percentile, they induced me. My first was induced at 37 weeks, my second at 38 weeks. I was on a sorta bed rest towards the end too with my second. Rest, eat healthy, and try to relax. I know it is stressful, but you will be closely watched. I pray for a healthy baby. If you ever want to talk feel free to contact me.",

Just ask them to keep an eye on your blood pressure and urine to make sure you don't get preeclampsia. I had to be induced at 35 weeks and from what I've researched iugr in a baby can be a sign. But I also had low amniotic fluid normal but on the low side and at 28 weeks I started gaining 4 to 7lbs a week and sometimes more. The preeclampsia didn't show until the 35th week.I was scared through out my whole pregnancy. I was told he was going to have clubbed hands and feet. At one point they thought he had Downs but found out they tested to early because they went by my last menstrual an of course I'm one of those irregular and ovulate a lot later. He was 3 weeks earlier than they thought. By the way his hands nor feet were clubbed.I did notice that he gained weight very quickly. He did stay in the 10th percentile for a long time but at 12 months they said he went in to the 25th. Iugr babies may be tiny but they sure are fighters and very strong. Don't worry and just drink lots of water eat healthy and stay away from fast food If you can. And also leave caffeine alone because I've read caffeine can stunt a baby's growth.\u00a0\u00a0Well too much caffeine.",

My doctor told me the IUGR for me is caused by my placenta not adequately nourishing the baby in the end. Baby2014 is right too, the baby may be small but they are strong fighters, both my girls were small for the first two years but are in the 30th percentiles now. Another thing your doctor may opt to have during delivery is having the special care team in the room. They were there for both my deliveries, luckily we hardly needed them. Like I said relax, eat healthy, and enjoy the remainder of your pregnancy. I'm only 14 weeks, so I have a long road ahead of me. Our IUGR babies will be perfect though!",

But she was measuring my belly and then listening to the baby's heart & looked at my chart. Then she measures again... I started getting nervous right there. She said that my fundel height is 3 weeks behind. So she sends me to u/s. Well now I have been told the baby is growth restricted. She was diagnosed with IUGR. So I am now high risk because of this. And have been told to expect her to be a low birth weight baby. :'(",
