I just checked out the weight/height chart on your profile, as well as pictures of Julian. He looks very healthy. And he has had steady growth, albeit it slow growth. He's still in the 25th percentile most of the time and that's actually perfectly fine.It's when babies dip below the 10th percentile that is *EXTREMELY* worrisome. Keep your chin up! I think Mr. Julian is going to be just fine. He's just itty bitty!All of my sister's kids are little skeletons. Okay, that's an exaggeration. But they've always been on the low-weight side, even though they eat a ton. And they are perfectly normal and healthy. I hope that this little information encourages you!Your doctors care for Julian and want to make sure he is alright. I know this upsets you but I encourage you to go in there with the mindset of proving the doctors wrong. Okay?! *HUGS*",

Fist the chances of him havign Cystic Fibrosis is slim to none because indeed tested when I became pregnant and I was negative. Second she decided that when we took him off the GERD meds ( Prevacid and Carafate) it seemed like he lost weight. Also she sent him for a few blood tests and she explained what they would be testing for...BTW I cant spel so I am sorry if they are spelled wrong* Metabolic problems including checking his electrolites.* Blood Count including his hemologic system, making sure his blood is clotting correctly etc...*Thyroid* Allergys as well as testing for a lactose intolerance.I am still a little confused on the tests so if anyone can shed some light on them that would be great.Also if those tests all come back noral then they will do some tests to make sure he is absorbing things the was he should as well as a last result the CF test!Please pray that everythingis ok and maybe the reflux (GERD) is what is doing this!

He either gains a ounce or looses a ounce and both the doctor and I have been concerned. Well today I took him in for sure that he had gained weight and I was very very wrong. He lost an ounce. So the doctor talked to me about testing for Cystic Fybrosis....I am so upset. They are going to start testing for the childhood illnesses that cause weight loss or lack of weight gain. I am sooo scared and feel so alone. Has anyone gone through this before? Any words of encouragement? Please pray ladies",
