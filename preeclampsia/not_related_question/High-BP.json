            "answer": "It sounds like they suspect you might have pre-eclampsia. You can google it for details. Monitoring your BP and the 24h urine test will confirm it if it's there. If you do have it and they can't keep your symptoms in check they will induce labor and you might have the baby sooner than you think. But at 35w+ your angel will be fine. Be sure to watch out for all the symptoms and contact your doctor immediately because this can be a life threatening condition both for you and your baby if left untreated. I've been on bedrest with high risk of preeclampsia (occasionally I have protein in my urine but I managed to control my bp without meds) since week 33. On Monday I am scheduled for a c-section (39w 4d).",

            "answer": "I am going through this right now. I did my 24 hour urine protein and the protein levels came back too high. The doctor had put me on a bp medication and we're going to see if that helps. If not, I'm not sure what's gonna Happen next. It's very scary. Not knowing for sure what's happening our going to happen is very stressful. I'm hoping for the best for yourself and me. I feel your pain and understand your worry. My doctor also didn't explain much further than that I had to high blood pressure. And in the moment I didn't really think to ask more questions. How all goes well. (:",

            "answer": "Thank you. I'm going to modify my diet to try and help get the BP down, hopefully that helps. My doctor won't let me have the vbac if I don't go into labor on my own. So it's kind of a get it together or schedule the c section.Thank you, again for the support and good luck to both you ladies.",

    "question": "I'm at 35w3d and at my apt yesterday the doctor told me my BP is slightly elevated. My BP was 184/84(I don't know what all the numbers actually mean), I have slight swelling in my legs and feet, occasional light headedness and bright spots in my peripheral.She sent me home with orders to check my BP 2x a day, rest as much as possible, and track the other symptoms. She also ordered all sorts of bloodwork and a 24hr urine collection for protein.Has anyone else dealt with this? The doctor didn't tell me what was going on other than high BP. I'm worried it'll keep me from having my vbac.",
