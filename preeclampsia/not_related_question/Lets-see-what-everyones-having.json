Although she does tend to have lazy days where I don't feel too much of anything. If I want to feel her theres a few things I try, one, I'll drink ice cold water or tea or juice and wait 15 min, or eat something (cookies work well) and do the same. I've also found out over the past week that if I take my mp3 player and hold it close to my lower stomach (pant line) that she usually starts jumping before the song is over, lol.I'm having my glucose test next Tuesday, and hoping it turns out ok. They are doing mine slightly earlier than most because I have PCOS and am overweight to begin with. If it turns out I have GD then I'll deal with it, and do whatever I can to keep us both healthy. That and preeclampsia are my two biggest fears of pregnancy, but I just try to take it a day at a time.I have no idea when either of my showers are. I know that I'll get one at work and one my aunt and mom with throw me I just don't know when lol. I think I'll go and do a baby registry this weekend if nothing else is going on.I have been feeling SOOO big lately, its awful. If I'm laying down flat, I have to roll and heave myself up, lol. I feel off balance, and my ankles swell throughout the day. I don't dare look at myself naked, I seem to find new stretchmarks everytime I do, lol. I also have noooo energy to do anything! Oh well... I have a feeling my pregnancy is going to go by sooo fast, and I'll be back to myself, with a BABY! :0) Sometimes I'm still in total shock!",

I feel it should have been done yesterday. It's too early to be nesting right? HA!Feeling a lot of movement and it's fun. There is a pattern to it like you ladies mentioned. I still haven't been able to get my husband to feel it. Seems like as soon as he touches my belly the baby goes to sleep. I hope he has that effect on the baby when it is born! hAha.Not feeling to large and in charge yet. Just having a little back pain here and there. I can usually remedy that with some stretching.
