            "answer": "NO!! DO NOT tell them!! Unless you do want the baby to be taken. Idk why these folks would tell you, to tell ... most likely, cause they see you as being unfit, to begin with. Sorry, just being honest! Most, \"good\", moms ... don't take drugs, while they're pregnant, that could potentially harm their baby, if they really love that child! I'm absolutely, NOT judging you. Cause I myself, am FAR from perfect and innocent. I honestly don't think you'll tell the Dr anyway. Simply because you threw in the story, about your friend, who used all through pregnancy, and didn't get caught. I'm guessing you're probably feeling guilty, for taking what you took, and want to figure out what to do, to relive yourself, of that guilt, you're feeling. Telling the Dr, WILL NOT, take that guilt, away! You simply have to forgive yourself, and DONT USE ANYMORE! You're responsible, for that baby, inside of you! Now that you've stopped, focus on doing everything right! Do right by the baby! Change your life, change your ways, for the better! Commit yourself, to being the best mother, you can be!! Be the difference, your child, made you to be!! However, if you do decide to use again, you absolutely deserve to have that baby taken from you!! I hope you make the right choices. All the best to you, and the baby!!",

Safety is #1~\u00a0\u00a0(and we aren't always aware of every single test they administer).On the other hand, if you chose NOT to be honest and didn't tell your dr about your infrequent use of oxy and they were to test the meconium, THEN is when you could have problems.\u00a0\u00a0NOT the other way around as someone above indicated.You will have such wonderful peace of mind\u263a\u00a0\u00a0No more worrying about it and you and your babe can totally enjoy your last weeks of pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Mothers who \"hide\" their history are the ones who end up with problems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I hope you'll come back and tell us how it went and how you are the most relaxed mommy in PA as you await the delivery of your precious babe~\u2665",

            "answer": "Hi Mommy, it's so good to hear from you, good you found your way back.So I feel you haven't told as you have been told the hospital policy is they don't check baby's meconium unless they are showing signs of withdrawal. I hope they stilck by this if your choosing not to tell.I guess what I'm saying not everything is black and white. Your baby shouldn't at all show signs of withdrawal, but would show positive if tested.What comes to mind is, if that's their policy, then surely telling them you used opiates only a few times would not be an issue. They would appreciate at your honesty. Because I means they're not going to act unless bub shows withdrawal. I'll leave it at that. Just wanted to give my thoughts.At the end of the day it's your choice, no one here wants you to feel pressured etc. We only want to support you, because we certainly do care.And we would love, I would love for you to keep coming to the forum, checking in letting us know hoe you are doing.You are so close, how has pregnancy treated you. Do you know what you're having?? You are nearly there! Soon you will get to meet your baby face to face... How amazing!!!Wow I wish it was me.. I'm so clucky!!!",
