I tried that also but it knocks me out for 12 hrs so thats outta the question since I have to take care of the other kids. And a half of a unisom doesn't help me sleep at all.Good luck to both y'all and hopefully we get to meet our lil ones soon!",

I'm really scared of my boy getting too big as well, cause i have it, but cause i pretty much have it under control they're not going to induce me any earlier. Its so hard walking, but i try everyday now to walk around the block, i wanna get things moving! I drink raspberry leaf tea everyday too, but i know that doesn't bring it on, just helps your labor go faster. I feel every day is dragging!!!

Since doc gave me the ok on Wednesday to start walking & stuff, I have done plenty of it to try to get things moving along.

This pregnancy they say everything is fine (apart from GD) and they're just leaving me go! I'm really feeling it this time, and i can't imagine going past my due date, i think i'll go insane.

I don't know, because i've never tried it! So this pregnancy is the first time i've had to just sit back and play the waiting game. Which is good, because i always wanted to try it this way, but it's been 10 years between children, and i'd forgotten just how bad it is towards the end. I hope i'm like you with your eldest, and go at 38+4! Was that natural?",

With my youngest so, they had to induce me, break my water and give me pain meds. They induced cuz on my due date I went in for my check up and his heartbeat was really high; had to break my water cuz I wasn't progressing enough after induction. But needed pain meds cuz he kept turning & wrapping cord around his neck and it kept getting tighter. The contractions were measuring 3 on the monitor but felt like a 10. He ended up in nicu for abt 3wks cuz of rapid heartbeat, head being black from cord being wrapped around his neck 2 times and extremely tight, and having jaundice to where he needed to be put under the lights to cure it. He was on heart meds for 18 months but is now off them and very healthy. You wouldn't know he was born with a heart condition by looking at him. Even thoughhe has outgrown the heart condition, it can come back at any time so I still worry all the time",

This is my 4th child and it has been completely different from the other 3. I'm so ready to have my boy here with me. Doc finally gave me the ok to start walking again after tellin me not to due to having so much back pain and him not wanting me to throw my back out....I know its still a lil early to try to induce naturally but I'm gonna start walking & hope it helps.
