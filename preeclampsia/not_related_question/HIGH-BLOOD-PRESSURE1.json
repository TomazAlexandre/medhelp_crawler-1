My doc was ok as long as my bottom number didn't go over 100. apparently, the risk of seizure goes way up if your bottom number (can't remember the medical term) goes over 100.hang in there mama!! it'll all be ok in the end as long as you take care of yourself. I agree with Christina on the baby aspirin thing though. Don't take them unless your doc says its ok.",

Then was in the hossy 5 weeks before Kurt was born. he was ten weeks early. i think the reason they put me in so quickly is...normal women you can check their urine for protein to see how far you can go before the baby is at risk...with me...you couldnt because even when i was not preg...i spilled ALOT of protein. The only thing they could watch with me was my q4hr BPs and my daily weight (that is so depressing, lol). What finally made them deliver Kurt was..I gained 8 pounds in 24 hours.XOXOXChristina",

I had severe pre-e and my son was delivered at 30 weeks, was on bedrest in the hospital way before that and on bedrest at home before the hossy, my son was perfect. You are in my prayers. Ask your dr. about the aspirin before taking it, it might be a good idea, but ask first.Good Luck!!!Are you lying on your left side all the time? When in the hossy, they made me lay in left side, with no light on at all (not even tv) that might help when it peaks.XOXOXOChristina",
