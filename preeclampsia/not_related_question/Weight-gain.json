I never did get back down to my pre pregnancy weight or even close before I got pregnant with my second (6years later) I'm currently in week 29 of my second pregnancy and have gained 27 lbs. don't be too hard on yourself either tho. If you dedicate yourself after having baby you can lose it. I just never made the time.\u00a0\u00a0Don't stress yourself over it. Good luck.",
