            "answer": "Either way people snarl at you. It's a very personal choice and you as the parent know what's best for you and the baby. My son was bottle fed because he was a preemie and needed a weight gainer there was nothing wrong with it my second was breast and bottle my third was breast fed and this one I would love to breastfeed but you never know until the baby is actually here. Also it's illegal I think for your job not to provide you with a location to breastfeed if that's ur reason for choosing bottle feeding look up ur state laws. They have to provide you breaks and a room with a lock on the door. I worked in the airport and was in a store by myself **** down the store every two hrs for tenty mins to go to my room. The technically they could have been fined but It was against law to tell me I couldn't pump so they just had to deal with it.",

            "answer": "Work is a very small reason of why I am bottle feeding over breast feeding. Every office is used in my branch so the only place to pump is a bathroom. I personally don't want to hang out in a bathroom stall while I pump just like breast feeding moms don't want to feed in a stall nor do I want to pump in my car lol. I decided before I was even pregnant which path I wanted to go with bottle feeding. I just wish people would learn to respect others choices! Which I know will never happen.",

            "answer": "Everyone always has to have an opinion about everything. Which is fine, but when they criticize you for your decisions, it gets annoying. There are many reasons women choose to breast or bottle feed, both medical and personal, its not like you are harming your baby by choosing one over the other. There have been so many advancements made in formula, that it is a good as breast milk for your baby. And just because you bottle feed, doesn't mean you are not bonding with your baby. I wanted to breastfeed my children, but due to numerous issues, my first had to be formula fed. I was able to breastfeed my second for 4 months, then went to formula. And I'm hoping to breastfeed thus one but who knows what will happen. All my children have been just fine. Formula or breast milk, all that really matters is that baby and mommy are happy and healthy.",

I don't think bottle feeding will make you less of a mother. Nor will it mean you love your baby less than someone who breastfeeds. I'm sure you have your reasons for choosing to bottle feed,\u00a0\u00a0and frankly,\u00a0\u00a0those reasons are no one's business. Personally,\u00a0\u00a0I think it's inappropriate to ask how you plan to feed your baby.\u00a0\u00a0I put that question in the same category as \"are you planning to go on birth control? \" it's no one's business.",

I wasnt able to breastfeed and it was the worst experience of my life. When my second son came i gave it a shot again but as soon as he was jaundice and not gaining weight i switched to formula right away and knew i was making the best decision. People are way to opinionated and its just not worth worrying about. My oldest is 3.5 and happy and healthy and my 2 month old has already doubled his birth weight and doing great. Enjoy your little one and ignore rude over opinionated people!",

Number one of course is how good it is for baby but number two is I'm lazy! Lol. I couldn't imagine anything worse than fumbling around, eyes hanging out of your head trying to make or heat a bottle, not to mention all that cleaning, especially when I can just hurl it out and shove it in their gob! Lol.... As far as I am concerned if a woman chooses bottle feeding from the start, I take my hat off to her.You do what's right for you and bub, screw everyone else and their opinions....Opinions are like but holes, everyone has one...",

My friends have tried to pressure me into it. Im bottle feeding cause I've got medication I'm scared to pass on to my baby. Its deemed safe but I'm still untrusting since its a newer medication. And bottle feeding had made things easier on me since my husband and family can help out with feedings while I rest from my csection.",

Some women (though a much,much smaller amount than who claim) don't make enough milk. Then there's the more modern ... you have to work! Its not the 50s anymore. 2 incomes are required these days. Some jobs have terrible leave rules too making it hard to stay home. So if you're the breadwinner... Absolutely I could see not breastfeeding. Who wants to whip their boobs out at work...every 2 hours? Youd never get your work done!Im too poor to bottle feed. And I HATE WIC!!!!!!!! They strut around in their crappy offices masquerading as doctors telling you how to take care of your children. Im not gonna put myself and kids through that for a few free cans of formula,dried beans and peanut butter even if I am breastfeeding.\u00a0\u00a0LolSorrt mini rant there lol.Anyway nobody should be telling you what to do? Id never tell someone what to do even being as for breastfeeding as I am. If I have a friend who is undecided then sure I encourage breastfeeding! If she decides to bottle feed then I shut up! Decision is made! Not even my decision! Other moms,I swear, they can be your best friends or worst enemies!Do what works for you!",

My mind won't be changed just because someone hounds me about it but I'm glad I have my husband, my moms, my sister and MIL support in bottle feeding. It makes it easy when you have a good support system :) thanks again ladies!! I hope you all enjoy your pregnancies :) I'll be delivering around my 37-38 week from preeclampsia and GD which makes our little girl a Christmas baby :)",

My sisters GM left her office for my sister to pump when she needed since they didn't have a designated room. Any room with a toilet doesnt meet the criteria.Formula has come a long way.my first was primarily formula fed- I only did it for 6 weeks. I just couldn't handle breast feeding. I'm hoping to do so longer with this one.",

I get crap for saying I want to breastfeed.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone else wants me to bottlefeed bc it is more convenient for THEM.\u00a0\u00a0Screw that.\u00a0\u00a0I also get a lot of sarcastic remarks.\u00a0\u00a0But I'm essentially a housewife and my husband and I both want me to be a stay at home mom.\u00a0\u00a0So, breastfeeding and not using bottles is extremely practical for me.I'm just saying, it goes both ways there are overly opinionated people on both sides.",

But even that can get into an entirely political debate that has absolutely nothing to do with bottle feeding vs breastfeeding.Your statement seems to imply some kind of jealousy in one standpoint over the other.Yes, disposable diapers are for some \"the easy way out\" as are pacifiers and not using EC... But I believe it is highly inaccurate to implicate that everyone who uses EC and cloth diapers is in some way jealous of those who use \"easy\" methods.For example: I live in the country where we don't have trash service.\u00a0\u00a0So, disposable diapers, plastic bags, etc...are absolute absurdities out here.\u00a0\u00a0We burn our trash... We don't burn plastic, nor would I want to burn diapers.\u00a0\u00a0Gross.\u00a0\u00a0In other words, we chose to buy our land/house out here.\u00a0\u00a0We chose this way of life and we don't envy anyone who lives with \"modern conveniences\" of plastic bags.\u00a0\u00a0We're not complete country bumpkins either... I've lived in LA and Dallas and Rome and I've experienced big cities with \"modern conveniences\", but *this* is my preference.My point is... I don't think people react because they're secretly wishing they personally chose a different path.\u00a0\u00a0I just believe people are opinionated and always have this insatiable desire to give \"advice\".\u00a0\u00a0Buuut it's out job to filter it out, take the criticisms with a grain of salt and apply the advice that fits best to our own personal situations.",

    "question": "For numerous reasons I have decided to bottle feed our daughter once she is here. I do understand the benefits of breast feeding vs bottle. Anytime someone asks me what we are choosing to do the mothers who breast fed like to snarl their nose when I say bottle feed. My mother had six kids and bottle fed all of us and we all turned out great! I never judge anyone who breast feeds. Its annoying how some breast feeding moms act like they are better or still choose to harp on you about breast feeding when you nicely said your bottle feeding. I mentioned to a girl that was going on about it that at work there is not a place to pump and I am unable just to leave and pump whenever I want (I work at a bank) and the girl then goes into me getting a pump and cover and just pump in my car. Yes, that's exactly what I want to do pump where my clients park. I wish people would respect someone's choice regardless if they choose to do the same or not. It has gotten to the point that I avoid the question lol. Sorry I know this is long but it has been driving me crazy!!",
