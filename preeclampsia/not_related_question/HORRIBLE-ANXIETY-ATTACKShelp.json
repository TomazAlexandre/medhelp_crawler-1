            "answer": "Hi bethbell,I have had anxiety for 4 years or so and have had different symptoms all the time (more so 4 years ago)..I was just wondering though, when you went to the hospital, did they talk to you about the blood sugar? It sounds like the low sugar count (57) could have caused you to feel faint, tingly, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Next time you feel that way, try some orange juice/fruit punch or something like that; it might help right away, and then you can try to pinpoint if it was the low sugar that was causing the balance issues/tingling....I used to fear not so much death per se, but the unknown, and also, monitor my heart etc.. I have learned, with a lot of practice, to simply be in the moment NOW...when you are not thinking of anything..things are ok (and in the real scheme of the world, it is!! )..... let us know how things are soon:) ttyl.....",

The brain is otherwise normalin signal intensity on all pulse sequences. No hemorrhage, mass effect,extra-axial collection. The basilar flow-voids are present. The calvarium,skull base, craniocervical relationships, and visualized extracranialstructures are remarkable for mild mucoperiosteal thickening and polypoidchange in the paranasal sinuses.IMPRESSION: Isolated focal abnormality in the splenium of the corpus callosumis quite unusual in a patient without known history of multiple sclerosis,traumatic diffuse axonal injury, or status epilepticus. Consider drugtoxicity, transient metabolic derangement, encephalitis or ADEM, PML, rareneoplasm, or hypoglycemia.

I feel all kinds of electric shock feelings all over my body tingling prickling. cold hot sensations. burning sensations..balance issues. sleep issues trembling...etc etc. help!!!!!!!! i also wondered if the anxiety disorder could be causing all these other symptoms as well. i mean even though i had a little abnormality the neurologist made it seem like it wasnt life threatening or anything. idk im so lost. help im going through it. and i have been feelin real dizzy these past couple of days. as well as a little weak but not extremely weak just a little.",
