Sleeping on your back cuts off circulation to your legs bc of a vein that your uterus presses on, it won't harm the baby and if your do turn onto your back, it won't really be that big of a deal. Lunchmeat is fine, just warm it up before you eat it. 600 mg of caffeine a day is \"okay\" during pregnancy.I have the book, \"What to expect when you're expecting\" its a great $12 investment I recommend every pregnant woman getting, it answers all of these questions. :)",

You can lay on your left or right side, however the left side provideds optimal blood supply. As far as diet coke- the fake sugar is what is bad. A normal coke is better. I drank at least a 44 oz coke every day with my first no issues. There is nothing wrong with orange juice except for the fact it is full of sugar as are most fruit juices even the no sugar added ones.\u00a0\u00a0Do not diet while pregnant but you can eat healthier. Just do not limit calories as that can keep you from giving baby enough nutrition.",

I'm 30 weeks and having a growth scan on friday to check on this bub's progress, i hope everything is on track. They say i could just have small babies cause i am a small person to start with.
