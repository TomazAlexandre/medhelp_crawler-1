She's worried because I had a lot of protein in my urine and the type of bacteria that keeps lingering around is the kind that causes kidney stones. My infection has gotten better but it's not completely gone. At first I was on some antibiotic....macro something but it didn't work now I'm on another that starts with CE.",

            "answer": "I just want you to know I had the same thing with my last pregnancy but they kept coming back not going away!! Its common to have uti's during pregnancy but if they dont go away with oral medication like macrobid which I took and it DIDNT do the trick you may have to go have the shots of antibotics. It CAN be extremely dangerous for UTI'S to keep reoccurring due to the fact that your body with start releasing protein in you urine you will notice swelling and high blood pressure( preeclampsia) This is exactly what happen to me and yes everyone is different but I would definatly consider talking with your doctor if they dont go away and doing the shots and get rid of the uti as soon as possible and try to manage it till baby is born. I hope this helped you and I will say before I got pregnant with my second I never had a uti issue.. after I had my baby I continued to have utis and they recently mad a suggesstion to have a hysterectomy... in the process of tests I found out I was pregnant. Now 9 weeks pregnant I\u00a0\u00a0have had 1 uti but hopefully no more.. good luck to you!! I hope this helped.",

    "question": "When I was pregnant with my now 7month old daughter I was diagnosed with a UTI(Urinary Tract Infection) and they gave me meds BUT they said they didn't work so they prescribed me a different type of meds for it... I don't think those meds worked either because when I went to my new dr they told me that I had a lot of something(I cant remember the name) in my urine and to just drink plenty of water,, and I did.! BUT even after I still had foul smelling urine as if I still had a UTI... NOW with this pregnancy I went to the dr and they told me I STILL had a UTI so they wanted to try a different medicine to see if it works and while I was taking it the smell and the cloudy look in my urine was gone... I thought I finally got rid of it.! Now its been about 3days since I finished my meds and the cloudy look and the foul smell is coming back,, not to mention the side pains I was having last night... Have anyone been through anything similar and if so what was the cause or your treatment for it.? I need to get rid of this ASAP.! The smell is embarrassing.!",
