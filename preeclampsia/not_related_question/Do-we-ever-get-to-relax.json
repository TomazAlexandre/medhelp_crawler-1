We also decided against any testing that didnt give us concrete results or anything that was invasive.\u00a0\u00a0So that just about ruled out most tests, including the NT scan.But like I posted in a question earlier today, during a routine US, the doctor told us that although it is too early for a NT scan anyways, she sees that there is fluid built up around both my twins necks!\u00a0\u00a0She made it sound like we had a diagnosis of down or some other chromosonal problem, said she was sorry about the news, etc.... we were devastated and so was my husband.Now we are faced with trying to decide whether to do the NT scan next week or not, and maybe doing other testing that we wouldnt have normally done just for peace of mind sake.\u00a0\u00a0I feel more disconnected with my babies since she mentioned that - not because I think about ending the pregnancy or anything like that, but just like, what if something happens or we get worse news.\u00a0\u00a0I cant think about anything but the health of the babies now.\u00a0\u00a0We most likely wouldnt do anything if the results of test were abnormal, but still.... i dont think it is healthy to worry for antoher 29 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0It is probably better to know and start to think about how to deal with it.Sorry about rambling.... just got so much going through my head, and I sooooo wish I could stop worrying :)",
