            "answer": "Wow effacement is the toughest part and it makes dilation so much easier when labor comes along. I know how hard it is to wait (as does anyone that has had to wait for the birth of their baby) but there is no way unless they are going to induce her that they can tell her exactly when she is going to deliver. I would say if she can stand the swelling that she is suffering to get out and walk as much as possible. I had the same problem when I was pregnant with my first son and I had to suck it up and I walked as much as I possibly could and eventually I dilated so much that my water broke. I hope she has the same luck!",

It's getting closer! :)The only thing is since her blood pressure was still a bit high they finally have decided to test her urine so hopefully that will turn out alright.One more thing, it's normal for the baby's heartbeat to keep going down the further along you get, right? I think I heard because he's getting bigger and stuff? Well, his heartbeat went down from the 150's last week to the 130's this week but they don't seem concerned. That's alright, though, right?",

Is there a way to try to estimate when the delivery will be? They're saying June 16th (so another 2 weeks) but she thinks they estimated it wrong because she knows exactly the day she got pregnant and is estimatimating it to be more like June 10th. Poor thing is so ready to get this over with, I know. She's miserable with back pain, swelling, etc.The baby has dropped the last couple of weeks too, it looks like.I'm just curious if it was a good sign today that she's 80% effaced and how close that might mean she might be? What do you all think?Oh yeah, she's nesting too, lol, has been for awhile. :)",
