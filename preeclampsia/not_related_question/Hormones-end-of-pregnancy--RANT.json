I cry when I see a supermodel on TV, especially if my husbands in the room. I feel ike a giant cow with these huge utters that are always in my way. I just cant help it when i cry :(. Ahh. I'm always sweating too It just started snowing and Ive been keeping my windows open a little at night still because I'm so damn hot. I cant sleep EVER anymore. Especially with this virus I have! I wake up LITERALLY every hour and pee or just from turning over and then once I'm awake it takes AT LEAST 40 min or so to go back to sleep. I cant take Unisom every single night because I take it like every few days and I know that cant be good right? My damn dog need to go pee at 7 30 on the dot every day and its freezing out tehre in the morning. And all I want is pop and coffee. and I cant have it. :(Ah, the joys of pregnancy.",
