            "answer": "There are 2 main types of \"pre-induction\" meds they use...Cytotec and Cervidil.Cytotec is actually a pill that is used to treat ulcers, but somehow someone got the bright idea of putting it in a womans vagina to see what happened!\u00a0\u00a0Hey!\u00a0\u00a0Guess what???\u00a0\u00a0It makes the cervix softer and more amenable to oxytocin.\u00a0\u00a0It is usually inserted vaginally, but some places you take it by mouth.\u00a0\u00a0There are usually multiple doses placed 2-4 hours apart.--the bad news is that occasionally it makes the uterus contract violently and continuosly.\u00a0\u00a0The tablet is so small it usually cannot be retrieved from the vagina if this happens.\u00a0\u00a0There are injectable medications that may stop the tetanic contractions, but this does not always work and if the baby cannot tolerate the contractions, an emergency C/S is done.\u00a0\u00a0This does not happen often, but is not unheard of.The other med, Cervidil, looks a bit like a shoestring and is placed high up against the cervix.\u00a0\u00a0The purpose is the same as Cytotec.\u00a0\u00a0The main difference is that Cervidil CAN be removed (there is a string hanging out) in case of excessive contractions. The downside is that removing the Cervidil doesn't always stop the contractions and you end up with a C/S as described above.\u00a0\u00a0Cervidil is placed once and left in place for 12 hours.Some people feel that Cervidil doesnt work quite as well as Cytotec, but I don't think there is a huge difference, myself.\u00a0\u00a0Cervidil also costs upwards of $400 for one, and Cytotec costs about 25 cents.\u00a0\u00a0So many docs are going with Cytotec.Occasionally, either med can put you right into labor without anything else having to be used.\u00a0\u00a0Not common, but does happen.I know I probably made it all sound bad, but really both these meds are used frequently and there is a low incidence of adverse reactions.",

            "answer": "My daughter was way overdue. They used Piticin or something like that. Labor started around 10am and she was born at 2:15pm. I begged for an epidural and dr didn't want to to do it. Said she would be here in an hour (Maybe around 1pm) but I couldn't deal w/ it anymore.It didn't help, I still felt the most painful pressure in the pelvic area. Then all of a sudden the nurse checked me and we had to get to the delivery room ASAP b/c she was on her way.",

            "answer": "i was 37 weeks when i was induced. I went in at 6 pm and they placed a tiny little pill ( cant remember the name)on my cervix to make me thin. The next morning they started oxytocin through an iv to start my contractions. I only dilated 1 cm the whole time. Once my water broke, the contractions hit a lot harder.They couldnt believe i was only 1 because my contractions were so strong.i ended up having a c section 26 hrs later because i wasnt progressing. Good luck hope, i could help!!",

Once they place the pill inside you, you have to lay straight back for 1 hour and after that you can sit up in bed but not get out...at least thats how it worked for me....",

Baby was deliever after 13 hours of intense pain. For my second my water broke at home around 11pm then by 11am contractions stopped.\u00a0\u00a0I opted for an epidural as it was explained to me that the potocin will intensefy the contractions and there isn't as much of a rest between contractions.\u00a0\u00a0Baby was deliver by 2:10 pm.\u00a0\u00a0Then my last baby at my check-up when they did the ultrasound my fluid went from 12cc to 2cc they sent me to the hospital and induced baby was deliever 8 hours later.\u00a0\u00a0Because of my high blood pressure my doctors starts at 34 weeks doing an ultrasound and non-stress test to keep close eye on baby and to make sure that I don't go into preeclampsia. Induction can cause the labor to be more painful, and that it doesn't always lead to c-section.\u00a0\u00a0Also after the induction started I wasn't allowed out of the bed.\u00a0\u00a0I had to use the bedpan when I had to go.\u00a0\u00a0I would hold it as long as I could which is a bad thing to due because it causes unneccessary pain.\u00a0\u00a0 Good Luck and hoping that you have a wonderful(as it could possiblly be) delievery.",
