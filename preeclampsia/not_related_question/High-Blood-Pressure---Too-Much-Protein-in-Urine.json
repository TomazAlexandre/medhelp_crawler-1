            "answer": "I had it also with my son who is 4,now. I'm pregnant with my second only 9 weeks. But they r already checking me for protein in urine. Most of the time if u have too much protein in urine u probably have preeclampsia. It can be scary but the drs will know exactly what to do. I was put on bed rest at 25 weeks with my son and didn't listen too good and ended up living in the hospital from 28 weeks til 37 weeks so if they say bed rest od listen. But I wouldn't worry too much just listen to drs.:)",
