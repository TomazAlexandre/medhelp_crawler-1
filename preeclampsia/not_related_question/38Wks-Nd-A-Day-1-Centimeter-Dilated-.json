            "answer": "Unless you or your baby's life is in danger there is no reason to undergo a cesarean section. Doctors like them because they make more money when they perform such a major surgery. Birth is a natural thing you can go from 0 to 10 in 2 hours or you can go from 0 to 10 throughout a couple weeks there is no normal.the only reason to have ac section is in case of an emergency meaning life-threatening. Even breech babies can be turned from the outside by a medical professional if you request it. If your baby is head down and you do not have placenta previa or any other medical condition that is pregnancy related like preeclampsia then you should not be worried about getting a c-section.

If you are not fully dilated and do not go into labor at 40 weeks then you are just not done cooking that baby",
