            "answer": "Only thing you can do is relax and be glad that you still have symptoms. Pregnancy after a miscarriage is hard but if youve already seen the heartbeat then your chance of miscarrying goes way down. Also, first 12 weeks of pregnancy your uterus is below your pubic bone so you wouldnt be showing yet so there is no reason to stress about that.",

I know its hard, but when you've seen a strong HB then your chances of having a missed m/c have signifigantly gone down. My OB told me at 9 weeks when I saw the HB I only had a 3% chance of having another m/c.I still drive everyone nuts sometimes with my constant worry, though now I worry about things like preeclampsia and gestational diabetes lol.",
