    "question": "I'm 34 weeks and today have been having bp ranging from 131/74 down to 110/54 with heart rate 110 or higher. I can barely breath and passed out once already. My head has so much pressure on it and I keep getting these surges of pain through my back followed by extreme nausea. I can feel pressure pushing down from the baby and having blurred vision and I feel so out of it and confused. I am already on bed rest due to elevated bp and have been resting all day. My OB's office isn't open till Tuesday and it's Sunday. What should I do?",
