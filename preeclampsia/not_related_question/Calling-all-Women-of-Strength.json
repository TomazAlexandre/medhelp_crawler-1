I know how much harder it gets each month to get that -ve! I did clomid for 5 cycles, 3 with iui, all bfn. We took this cycle off b/c I had a cyst on my left ovary, but were still able to try naturally and am currently 6 dpo. When/if af shows, I'll start my first cycle of Follistim, and I am sooo excited! I always produced multiple eggs with clomid, just never got pregnant. I've read so may +ve stories about Follistim, so I'm really hoping it works in the first couple of cycles on it! I would definately say if you want to be more aggressive about ttc, which i'm sure you are :), definately move on to the injections! I could kick myself in the butt for waiting this long to start them! Good luck in whatever decision you make! :)naf- I'm sorry you've\u00a0\u00a0been feeling down! :(\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully you will get a +ve opk soon, and that will build your spirits up! :) I hope you do get your bfp this cycle, but if not, it may be a good break to have a few stress free cycles before actively trying again!Guesito- I sent you a message, but congrats on seeing your little one today! :) I know it put your anxiety at ease! Now just enjoy being pregnant!!!I have to check our old thread, because I think I missed out on some stuff... Be right back! ;)",

I ovulated on CD 9! I'm still in shock over that one! :) I'm not really feeling anything, my bbs were super sore yesterday, and I had a back ache from hell yesterday, but nothing really bad today! I'm not worried about this cycle though, I'm anxious for next cycle so I can start my injections!!!! :) How are you?Hannah- Isn't it funny how you can be so busy and then you realize you're already in the 2 ww! I swear that's exactly how it went for me this cycle! Thank goodness I temp every morning, because I definately wouldn't of thought I would ovulate so early, and we caught it too, so that was good! :) Hopefully your 2ww flies by, and you get great news in 2 weeks! :)jmh- I'm so sorry you got bad news today! :( Just keep your chin up, and hopefully next time your follies will cooperate and be mature on your right\u00a0\u00a0side! :) It's all a race when it comes to them maturing, so you just never know which side will win! I know how hard that must be for you! :( Just look forward to next cycle, ok? (( Hugs))Shysana- Sorry to hear you're not feeling well! It seems like a lot of people aren't feeling well these days!

Start testing with those opk's girl! :)ad_06- Our insurance always said they'd only pay for the first visit to our RE, and that we had to cover the rest of the costs. And that's exactly how it went, for the first few months, and then all of a sudden they started paying for my u/s and my visits!? Hey, I'm not argueing! :) Maybe you'll luck out, and that'll happen for you too! :)Keyan- Sending lots of +ve karma your way that af stays away!! I've been peaking at your chart the past few days! :) Staying very hopeful for you!!Ok, i'm tired now! :) Going to bed, I've had a long day! See y'all in the morning! :)",

I can imagine that you're hurting for her, and feel helpless because there's nothing you can do right now to help her! :(\u00a0\u00a0I will definately keep her in my prayers!Shysana- I'm glad you finally are starting to feel better! Your meds won't affect the baby if you are pregnant. I was sooo sick when I was pregnant, and took medicine constantly not knowing I was pregnant! The first 3 months are the most important, but those little ones stay tough! Good luck to you! Don't get discouraged if your test on Sunday is -ve, because it will still be early, but it is a good start date to test! :)Keyan- You're welcome! I'm always checking on my friends! :) I'm so glad af still hasn't shown for you! That's a great sign that your temps are still up too!!! Yes, i'm half way through, and i'm just really hoping af shows on time! I refuse to take provera again to induce a period! My body didn't start getting all messed up until I started taking those stupid pills! If af still hasn't shown 14 dpo and I'm not pregnant, OH WELL! :) It'll come when it comes, and then I can start injections! Yay! :) No, I'm not taking any meds, or progesterone, no hcg shot, notta! This was a total med free cycle! My bbs got sore last cycle around 8 dpo, this time 3 dpo. It's normal for me, but I like your enthusiasm and hope it is from a bfp! :)Stacey- Wow! That's so cool you made 2 more follies! It's those unexpected suprises that we love so much! :) That's sooo awesome your retrieval is coming so soon! I hope the rest of this week flies by, and you can enjoy your whole next week off! Well, of course you'll be resting, but you still won't be at work! :) Getting excited!!!!! :)Hannah- You're welcome sweetie! That's what we're here for , complete support for each other! :) I'm glad you feel so happy today! I know ttc can make you so anxious and frustrated, but we have to believe that God has his reasons for making us wait, and when we do get pregnant, we'll have him to thank! :) Keep up the positive attitude! :)Candie- Thanks, you and me both! :) No more provera though, I don't want my next cycle all messed up! I'm sick of abnormal cycles! I hope you do that +ve opk close to the weekend right along with Mommyin09! Then you'll both have all weekend to relax... NOT! ;)Mommyin09- Thanks for doing a great job of keeping our list updated everyday! We don't thank you enough! :) And I completely agree with your comment! I don't think it's a good idea to say that either! We're all here to support each other, not make anyone upset or hurt anyone's feelings! Hope you had a good day at work! :)",

That's cool your dh is going right along with it, and opted for this route! :) It is definately a much cheaper route to take, and you still have more options if for some reason you need them, which you know we're all hoping you don't! ;)mrspace- I'm sooo glad to hear your mom is doing ok! What a relief! Thank you for looking at my pictures! I know it's really hard for you all to see them too! :( And thank you so much for calling me a wonderful mommy! ((Hugs)) That's just so sweet of you to say! That's so cute you crochet! I tried to learn a few years back, and could do the first row, but could never figure out how to continue to a second row! No one tried to teach me though, I just learned from a book! I think I would have learned it better if someone was acutally showing me! :) I hope you do remember to upload some pics of your baby blankets you've made! You'll be using them before you know it! ;)Keyan- I haven't peeked at your O tracker yet, but i'm glad to hear your temps are still up and you have no signs of af showing yet!! I really hope this is it for you girl! That's so sweet of you to imagine all the baby girls running around playing together! Everytime we visit her and are getting ready to leave, we tell her we love her, and then we say good-bye to all the girls and tell them to play nice together! :) My aunt lives in California, and she wrote Kayln a birthday poem, and it's along the extent that all the babies in Heaven are all playing together, and they were just waiting for kayln!

So I'm trying to get through a bunch of it without buying more (unless it's absolutely necessary to finish a project).\u00a0\u00a0I'm working on a yellow baby blanket right now that has hearts all over it and says \"Bundle of Love\".\u00a0\u00a0I'm loving it already and I just started it yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0Crocheting is pretty easy if you have someone there teaching you the basics.\u00a0\u00a0And once you know the basics it's easy to learn the hard stuff.\u00a0\u00a0Although... I still don't know a lot of the hard stuff.\u00a0\u00a0I'm pretty content with my knowledge.\u00a0\u00a0I try new projects a lot though.\u00a0\u00a0The one I'm working on right now is a new pattern. I will be sure to post pictures tonight. I left myself a sticky note on my laptop!\u00a0\u00a0So hopefully I'll remember. Ha ha.AF seems to be lightening up again but the cramps are still really bad today, so hopefully it'll stop here in another day or two.\u00a0\u00a0Some people have told me that clomid can make you O later than normal.\u00a0\u00a0But we're watching it.\u00a0\u00a0If I O normally, I should O around the end of next week.",

DH ran after him (in the 4 inches of snow, wearing only boxers and no shoes or socks or anything) and of course caught him.\u00a0\u00a0DH is a Marine..lol the kid had no chance.\u00a0\u00a0DH got him on the ground and at about that time I caught up with them.\u00a0\u00a0I had thrown my robe and snowboots on and ran after them, calling the police.\u00a0\u00a0To be quite honest I was a little scared that DH would really hurt him.\u00a0\u00a0He did a little.\u00a0\u00a0The kid tried to fight him and DH pushed his head down on the concrete, so the kid has some scratches on his face.\u00a0\u00a0The police came and took care of everything though.\u00a0\u00a0The stupid kid took cookies. COOKIES!\u00a0\u00a0Idiot.\u00a0\u00a0I had baked snickerdoodle cookies last night and left them on the table.\u00a0\u00a0He broke in to do damage but all he got to was the shower.\u00a0\u00a0He knocked the showerhead/pipe off.\u00a0\u00a0I should also mention that he came in with a metal bat.\u00a0\u00a0But left it when he ran away from DH.\u00a0\u00a0So we have no working shower and I feel gross this morning.\u00a0\u00a0DHhas people coming to fix it this morning so hopefully I'll get to take a shower on my lunch break.Sorry that was such a long story.\u00a0\u00a0It was a crazy night!\u00a0\u00a0Ha ha.Other than that, I'm doing pretty well.\u00a0\u00a0AF has tapered a little. It's more, medium now.\u00a0\u00a0So that's good.\u00a0\u00a0Still lots of bad cramps. I'm hoping that it ends soon.\u00a0\u00a0I should O sometime around next weekend.",

It'll be weird, b/c I'm only 11 dpo and have never started before 14 dpo, but will take it now if it's coming so I can start my injections! I only got 4 hours of sleep last night after working a loonnngg day at work yesterday, and waking up and going straight to work today. Do you think maybe that's why my temps were so low today? I'm pretty sure I have read somewhere that as long as you sleep for 3 hours, you can take your temp and it should be accurate as long as you take it at the same time like normal?! I'm not sure, maybe i'll do some research! :) I did start cramping yesterday while I was getting ready for work, and it's been worse today, well, this morning anyways. I haven't had them since about 9 am today. Anyway.....Mommyin09- I'm suprised you still haven't gotten your +ve opk! I guess the every other month trend ( CD 13 or 15) is broken! :( Your temps did drop today, so hopefully in the next couple days you'll get it! That'd be cool if you were still able to do iui, but if not, you know the routine! ;) I hope you and dh have a great anniversary, and a great mini-vaca!! :)Stacey- Tomorrow's the big day! Hope everything goes well, and I can't wait till your transfer on Thursday! :) It'll be exciting to hear how many embryos they transfer! Be sure and keep us posted on how you're doing over the next few days!!! I'll be praying for a successful ivf for you, my friend! :)yogachick- So excited that you're starting your Follistim tonight!! :) I can't wait to start mine! Hopefully we'll be close enough in our cycles if af will hurry up and show for me! It'd be great to go through our first round of injections together! :)Keyan- I know seeing that -ve is hard, but at least af still hasn't shown! That's an awesome sign!!! Good luck! :)Guesito- We'll be anxious to see how everything goes on Tuesday! You are exactly right, the nervousness will always be there during a pregnancy for anyone who has lost a baby, or even for those who haven't! It's all in God's hands, all we can do is put our trust in Him! :)Pyar- Sorry about your spotting, but until it's a full flow, don't get discouraged! Even if af shows, there's always more options! Stay strong! :)Candie- Have you gotten your +ve opk yet? I'll be shocked if you haven't! You always ovulate so quick in your cycles! Maybe we're switching spots here! :)Hope everyone had a great weekend, and to those of you who are off next week\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ( Mommyin09 & Stacey :), enjoy it!",

I didn't take OPKs before then so I'm not sure about before then. We finished up the clomid on Saturday so I'm hoping it'll work!\u00a0\u00a0We'll have to wait and see!guesito- I am so excited to see how your u/s goes tomorrow!\u00a0\u00a0I know it'll be amazing hearing your little one's heartbeat.\u00a0\u00a0It's a beautiful thing!\u00a0\u00a0Way to go, momma!keyan- Congrats on AF showing. I know how you feel about that.\u00a0\u00a0I was on progesterone to induce mine this cycle and I was so glad when it actually started!\u00a0\u00a0One step in the right direction, right?\u00a0\u00a0I hope you had a great weekend!stacey- Good luck with the retrieval!\u00a0\u00a0I have no idea what all that entails, but good luck! Ha ha.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not very educated when it comes to the TTC scene.\u00a0\u00a0I know some about what I'm going through, but I'm learning just by reading about all of you.\u00a0\u00a0You have all my thoughts and wishes!\u00a0\u00a0Keeping my fingers crossed for you, sweetie.candie- Thanks for the sweet comments about my photos.\u00a0\u00a0I love crocheting.\u00a0\u00a0The middle of the blanket that I'm working on is turning out to be MUCH harder than I anticipated.\u00a0\u00a0The blanket is worked in two parts and I have the outside done.\u00a0\u00a0The inside is kicking my butt!\u00a0\u00a0Our puppies are our babies lol.\u00a0\u00a0Although they're not really puppies anymore ha ha!\u00a0\u00a0I still can't believe how big Max is getting!luvkayln- Hey girl!!! Sorry I wasn't around much this weekend!\u00a0\u00a0I am almost positive that AF has finally ended. It got really light last night and today it's just barely spotting.\u00a0\u00a0I'm still having some cramps but oh well.\u00a0\u00a0At least I'm not bleeding as much!\u00a0\u00a0As far as I'm aware...we're not having u/s to check my follies.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure why.\u00a0\u00a0Our dr just said to do the charting and so on.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just nervous that I won't ovulate at all.\u00a0\u00a0I've had all\u00a0\u00a0-OPKs so far, but I'm also only on CD10.\u00a0\u00a0So, I'm still watching to see what happens.\u00a0\u00a0I'm definately keeping my fingers crossed.Okay now for my update:Af has finally started to stop.\u00a0\u00a0I think it's done now lol.\u00a0\u00a0Just barely spotting today.\u00a0\u00a0As I told luvkayln, I'm not having u/s to check the follies.\u00a0\u00a0We're not doing IUI or anything so I didn't even know we were supposed to.\u00a0\u00a0We're just charting and taking the meds this time.\u00a0\u00a0It's kind of nice not to have to take any pills now lol.\u00a0\u00a0I'm enjoying it while I can.\u00a0\u00a0Oh.. well I'm still taking my prenatals, but that's different lol.\u00a0\u00a0I love that my temps are starting to regulate. It's been in a nice little pattern the last few days.\u00a0\u00a0I'm hoping that's a good sign.DH has been SO amazing lately.\u00a0\u00a0Last night he STARTED a big conversation about TTC.\u00a0\u00a0He usually doesn't like to talk about it a whole lot because he doesn't understand it all.\u00a0\u00a0But last night he was so interested in it all!\u00a0\u00a0He kept asking me what we needed to do now, when I should O, when we're supposed to BD, and what happens after that.\u00a0\u00a0He was so great and supportive. He's so excited.\u00a0\u00a0He emailed me a bunch of pictures while he was at work. Pictures of baby rooms that he liked.\u00a0\u00a0He said that he can't wait til we buy a house (after January) and start to work on the baby room.\u00a0\u00a0He said it's the first room he wants to do lol. He's adorable.We had DH's christmas party on Saturday. It was okay.\u00a0\u00a0We got 75 dollars in \"city bucks\" to use anywhere in town.\u00a0\u00a0Not to shabby. Unfortunately my MIL sat next to me the whole night playing the \"I'm the worlds best MIL\" game. Her and I DO NOT get along.\u00a0\u00a0I tried for 7 years to make her like me, and NOTHING worked. She kicked me out of her home several times and it has just been a nightmare. She accused me of lying about my m/cs, saying that I had abortions because I didn't know who the father was.\u00a0\u00a0It has been terrible.\u00a0\u00a0But luckily, DH has stood by me the whole time. The last time, he walked out on his family.\u00a0\u00a0He told his mom that she had been given a choice to either accept me as a daughter or lose her only son.\u00a0\u00a0And because she kicked me out, she'd made her choice.\u00a0\u00a0We didn't speak to them for over 6 months before she finally came and appologized.\u00a0\u00a0It's just been one thing after another with her. But at this point, now that we're married, she's played semi-nice.\u00a0\u00a0She still tells me that we need to wait to have a baby so that WHEN (not if) her son decides to divorce me, there won't be children involved.\u00a0\u00a0But I just ignore her. I could care less at this point.\u00a0\u00a0I'm married to him, we love each other, and we WILL have a baby.\u00a0\u00a0That's all that matters.Sorry for my little venting session there.Other than that everything is going well.\u00a0\u00a0My momma is doing great and has started to heal quite well.As of right now, that's all I know!\u00a0\u00a0Ha ha.\u00a0\u00a0Have a great day everyone!",

            "answer": "mrspace- Wow! Your mil sounds like a GREAT person! ( Did you catch my sarcasm!? :) I can't believe she would say any of that to you! I'm glad you are a bigger person than her, and can just look over it all! You are right, you WILL have her son's baby, and you will be together and have a happy family! That shocks me that she would say you were lying about your m/c's and you had abortions b/c you didn't know who the father was!!! Who the hell is she to say anything like that! M/c's are hard enough, you don't need someone, especially your mil, saying you lied about them! WTF!!!? I'm glad af is finally lightening up for you! That had me a little concerned! I'm sure it's the transition from not ovulating for a few months, then starting af and taking something to induce ovulation that's got your body acting like it is. Don't worry about your -ve opk's. You are still very early in your cycle. I usually ovulated on CD 16 or 18 with clomid, but everyone is different. You may ovulate sooner or later than that. Just keep testing b/c you don't want to miss it! :) Besides, your temps will tell you for sure when you ovulated! I'll be more than happy to help with that when the time comes! :) I'm not sure though, why your doc is doing u/s while you're on clomid?! Mommyin09 never did iui with clomid either, just timed intercourse, but she always had an u/s to show how many follies she had. I would ask your doc why they aren't monitering you?! Your dh is so cute!! :) I LOVE that he's so interested in ttc, and is anxious to get the baby's room ready! That's so sweet he's emailing you pics of baby rooms that he likes! Awww... what a sweetie! :) I'm glad your mom is feeling better! Hopefully she'll be feeling like herself again in time for the holidays!Babymomma- I'm sorry af showed! :( You CAN do another cycle! Stay strong, we're all here to support you! :) I'm 12 dpo today, and feel af coming too! I'm not upset, just ready for it to be here so I can keep going!Candie- I was wondering if you O'd yet! :) Glad to hear you're 3 dpo already!! I bet you did catch the end of your surge, especially if you saw a light line on Thursday, and nothing since! Plus,\u00a0\u00a0your temps went up on Saturday and have stayed up! I peaked at your chart, I totally agree that you are 3 dpo! :) Looks like you and Mommyin09 are once again very close in the 2ww! I hope this is it for both of you, just in time for Christmas!!! Good luck sweetie!!Mommyin09- I'm PATIENTLY waiting to see how it went!! :) Ok, not so patiently waiting! I'm anxious, and sooo excited for you!! :) I'll be checking in throughout the day to see your update!! :)",

About your LAP, hopefully you won't need it, but I just have a good feeling about it, I really BELEIVE is what I need...I've been thinking about it for the past 2 years, and finally I decided to do it, MY regular OBGYN, says I shouldn't do it, this is one thing that was keeping me from doing it and when I said to him that I was already 30 and that we already were pretty sure I have endometriosis, and that we needed to ck everything inside, place my ovaries were the belong and \"clean\" , that's when he said that he would refer me and now I am own my way...I am not saying it will be my Miracle treatment, but I sure hope soooo, and if not, atleast I know I tried!Luvkayln: Thanks for your support! ..You made me laugh on the note for me! I hope you get your BFP and if not that AF doesn't make you wait on the injections!Pyar: Sorry about AF...can't help much on your questions, the good thing is that one good egg and one good swimmer is all you need to conceive your baby....I guess since IVF is so expensive you would want to have many eggs so that your possibilities of good embryos to transfer are higher. I am sure other girls here will be able to help you out!MrSpace: MILs can be !@#$% sometimes!! LOL....I had an early M/C back in MAY and before that dh, me and my MIL had a good comunication and especially DH and her had a great relationship, well she found out that we had a m/c, her words of comfort were,\u00a0\u00a0\"so you can make a gril pregnant\" (not necessarily me) and dh just looked at her....imagine him all sad because of what happend and this is what his mom says to him, nothing about I am sorry for you loss or anything, like if she didn't appreciate that she lost a grandbaby....after this incident, me and her are about the same, but I feel bad for DH cause he lost the support of his mom, I mean, I told him to talk to her about it, and he said to me that it wasn't worth it, that she wouldn't be able to REALLY understand why it was so upsetting to us what she said, that she would just feel bad cause he would tell her and not because she understood.As of me, well I have to call my GYN's office to see when I can come in...I beleive after AF is over, so probably next week!.... I got my blood work yesterday and everything TO ME, looks like is fine, let's hope the doc thinks the same!",

And every time I go there, DH gets mad because I have a shopping cart FULL of yarn and stuff.\u00a0\u00a0It's great though.\u00a0\u00a0I am slowing the crocheting down though because I'm starting to get busy.\u00a0\u00a0I work 40 hrs a week plus I have an online store (cafepress).\u00a0\u00a0My store isn't doing so hot right now (thank you, economy) so I'm putting a lot of time and effort into that right now. I'll pick up the blankets later this week probably.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with Keyan, I hope that AF doesn't show and instead, you get a BFP for Christmas!\u00a0\u00a0That would be wonderful!\u00a0\u00a0Lord knows you deserve it girlie!Mommyin09- Once again, you amaze me with how well you keep up with everyone!\u00a0\u00a0It's amazing having someone like you who really takes an interest.\u00a0\u00a0And that goes to everyone else as well...thanks for being so supportive of everyone. It's a beautiful thing!Guesito- I can't wait to hear how the u/s went today!\u00a0\u00a0You are one blessed momma!Candie- Yes, MIL's can be terrible.\u00a0\u00a0Mine sure can!\u00a0\u00a0Honestly, I think mine is bi-polar. She loves me one day, and hates me the next.\u00a0\u00a0And I know it's a terrible thing to say but I just don't care in the slightest anymore. I don't care if she's happy or anything. It's not worth it.\u00a0\u00a0I spent years worrying and fretting and stressing over her.\u00a0\u00a0No more.\u00a0\u00a0I have other things to worry about!\u00a0\u00a0And I'm trying really hard to live a more \"stress-free\" kind of life.\u00a0\u00a0It's difficult since I'm such a huge worry-wart but oh well. I'm doing my best to stay positive and stree-free.As for me, I'm doing pretty well this morning.\u00a0\u00a0I don't feel good at all, but I'm happy.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure why. lol.\u00a0\u00a0 I had a terrible headache last night.\u00a0\u00a0I think I'm trying to catch a head cold.\u00a0\u00a0I had a slight fever of 99.8 last night and then my temp this morning was down to 96.0!\u00a0\u00a0I don't get it.\u00a0\u00a0I should also explain that I have a low normal temp.\u00a0\u00a0My normal temp runs around 96.7-97.0 .\u00a0\u00a0 Anyway.\u00a0\u00a0DH was amazing ONCE AGAIN!\u00a0\u00a0We were laying in bed trying to sleep and I was crying because my head hurt so bad. So he rolled over to me and rubbed my head/neck and ran his fingers through my hair for at least an hour, til I fell asleep finally.\u00a0\u00a0He's amazing.\u00a0\u00a0I'm the luckiest woman alive.AF has officially stopped!\u00a0\u00a0Happy Dance Time!\u00a0\u00a0But I'm still having a lot of pain in my lower back and hips.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know why.\u00a0\u00a0My appetite is MAJORLY decreased also. Which probably isn't a bad thing since I need to lose like 50lbs!\u00a0\u00a0Not really.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor said that I should lose 15-20lbs to be healthier.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing too major. I just hate my weight right now.\u00a0\u00a02 years ago I weighed 135lbs.\u00a0\u00a0Now I'm at 215lbs.\u00a0\u00a0It *****.\u00a0\u00a0But I carry it well (the doctor didn't even believe the scale at first).\u00a0\u00a0And I'm working on it.\u00a0\u00a0I'm eating healthier and trying to exercise more. Having very little energy definately doesn't help.Anyway, I hope everyone is doing great today!",

I'm sure that's what they'll go with. He said he's starting me out really low, because he thinks i'll respond very well to the meds. Let's hope he's right! :) How many days did you stim for?

I always eat so much around the holiday's! :) But you are a determined, smart women! I know you can do it! :) Sorry you have to be stuck at work! I left about an hour ago, and now am just waiting for dh to get home... tick,tock... :) I hope you start to feel better soon!wishandaprayer- Yes, I will definately change your status tomorrow! :) You're welcome for helping you figure it all out! That's what friends are for! ;)Candie- Have you thought about going back on meds for a while? What about trying injections next cycle if you don't get your +ve this time around. It's just a thought. I know you feel better being off the meds, I do too. But i'm anxious, and ready for these injections. I've read so many success stories with them, I just hope that will be me soon! :) Bny807 and I would love another follistim buddy! :)hannah- Have you seen a doctor yet? Are you starting to feel any better! I hope so!!!rachjas- Your dh's SA sounds normal. It's normal for men to have some abnormal sperm. My dh had a SA done before we even got pregnant with Kayln, and his was like 85% normal, 15% abnormal or dead. If they're saying his is a little on the lower side, they're probably just saying his sperm forms are\u00a0\u00a0just below the average \"normal\" results. I wouldn't worry about it. His motility is good, and as long as he's got some normal formed sperm that are rapidly moving, that's all you need to get pregnant! :)Mommyin09- I miss you already! :)",

Good luck with the u/s on Friday.Rachjas - Your DH has enough sperm to fertilize at least 1 egg. Don't worry at all, when my DH took semen results I thought that there isn't a chance for us only 25% of 100% sperms were OK, so we were crushed, we were crying and feeling that we will not have a fruit of our love! Next day we transfered them in millions there were 15 or 20 million from 25% and our Doc. said to not worry at all because U need only 1 sperm to fertilize 1 egg:-)Shysana - Hopefully AF is still staying away from U, Wish U +BF from my heart\u00a0\u00a0:) God Bless U with a babyStacey - I'm so hapy for UUUUUUUUUUUUU:-) God bless U!!

I like your sentence a lot \"So strange that we have 9 potential children sitting in a lab!\" :-)Joyce dear please do something that U really want to do, during the time that U are waiting maternal support. I don't know why are U needing them for, is that any procedure in your country? God bless, take care, be positive u are prego!!!Keyan- when did U do your HSG? U know that 6 months after the HSG chances to get pregnant are very big! God Bless U with a baby!Candy - take care of your self! God Bless U with a babyI'm doing fine. I'm happy Christmas is coming, yesterday started cleaning the house, we will have a lot of guests this year. About TTC this month we decided to try without any help from Doc, (like measuring the follicles as i did previously) and we will see what will happen. Maybe IUI will be our next step in year 2009!I have question - Do any of U take any medicine like vitamin E, multivitamins and minerals, folic acid and aspirin before planning to became pregnant?I'm going to watch movie on TV, I'm home alone, my DH is at work third shift this week and going to sleep soon.Have a good day and evening everyone!\u00a0\u00a0:)",

Should I not consider af\u00a0\u00a0due yet since it didn't come until 21 dpo last cycle? Don't think i'm pregnant, b/c i'm not!

Sean was driving, and they were drunk! :( Sean spent 3 almost 4 years in prison for it, going in when he was only 17! We were best friends when this all happened! Sean broke his ribs, broke his left leg and now has a steel rod holding his bone together in his leg, with 3 screws keeping it in place. Sean has really been through a lot, and it's very hard for him. He feels like he's literally cursed, with losing Zach and then our babies! :( He's on crutches now, because everytime winter comes around, his hip/leg starts really messing with him. It's like he has arthritus, he just can't handle it! He went to the doctor yesterday because he was literally crying he couldn't walk. So he finally went to the doctor and they did x-rays and found lots of bruising and one of the screws is bent! She put him on crutches until monday, and is supposed to come back monday. He's got pain meds now, and he's already starting to feel better. He's just been staying off of it, and using his crutches when we do go out, taking hot baths and using the heating pad. He's really not a bad person, you guys so please don't think that! :( He was young when all this happened, and he's had a hard lesson to learn! :(",

I'm also sorry that he has pain in his leg and also that he have emotional pain that he has to carry for the rest of his life as Candie said.I don't think also that he's a bad person at all.\u00a0\u00a0I feel very sad though about him. God bless him and U together. I'm happy that he found U and I wish U both a very happy and long life together with many babies around U 2.:-)My DH also drinks but usually control him self, when he is driving or when we are together, I drive always but I also likes red vine too. One week ago he went out with our best men, but that day our best man came and pick him up, so my DH came home with red eyes, he was sleepy, I have never seen him in that way before, I asked him is he drunk he said no of course, \"no one who is drunk will admit that is drunk\" he didn't even kiss me when he went to bad ??? (first time since we are together, I hope last :-), so next day he didn't know how he came back home?!? he phoned our best man to ask about it, so best man said that he used a cap - taxi?!?! I was very upset b/e this gets to happen when he goes out with our best man, his best friend, father of 2 children (3 and 1 years old)?!?! So you're right, it is a very hard lesson to learn. Wish U all the best, take care of your selfs and your future. Baby dust 2 U!\u00a0\u00a0:)Candie - you are more than welcome my friend! Thanks for the advice. I'm drinking vitamins and folic acid too, but I wanted to know does everyone else in TTC is doing that. Have a blessed day!Stacey - Good luck today!\u00a0\u00a0I can't wait to hear news from U tomorrow, in my time. Take care, God bless UShysana - Congrats to DH on his job!\u00a0\u00a0I'm happy for him!\u00a0\u00a0I hope you get more good news soon!!\u00a0\u00a0Baby dust 2 U :)Hannah - I hope you are feeling better. Relax and think positively! All the best 2 U.Mrspace - Don't lose faith! Relax and wait. Wish U big fat +BF soon!!:-) I'm very happy for U mammy also, and I wish her quick recovery!Guestito - wish to hear beautiful news from u tomorrow! Take care mammy in 2009:-)Michelle - My prayers are with you. God Bless UKeyan - Thinking of U. God bless U 2!Mamushko - nedostajesh mi moja drugarice:-)Arlotheslug - My prayers are with U 2. God bless UI'm thinking that I'm going to catch a cold, I feel tired all day, my body hurts especially my legs and don't know why, maybe b/c the weather is very cold down here!But I did my English cookies 2 hours ago and I'm happy for that, and now I'm going to sleep.Have a nice day and evening all of U.

Well, we bd tonight, woo hoo! :) We went out to dinner, went and got dog food and bird food, came home and I couldn't find Sean! So I went to the bedroom, b/c I thought maybe he was on the compter, but he was on the bed \"waiting\" for me!!! LOL I about died laughing!! :) He just had a big grin on his face, laying there butt naked! :) Tmi, I know! :) But it was too funny, I just had to share! I didn't buy any opk's while we were at the store, I just figure I'll watch my temps and just bd everyday until I ovulate. And hopefully I will ovulate! Fingers X'd!Mommyin09- I'm so glad you'll be back tomorrow! :) We've all missed you! When you post our updated list tomorrow, will you change me to CD 25? Can you believe that about my ovulation? Crazy, huh?! But remember, I even asked you last week what you thought about it, if I ovulated or not. It's been a doubt in the back of my since my temps went down...Oh, and by the way, I changed my \"2 dpo\" temps, because that was the day after Thanksgiving, and I got up at 4 am to go shopping. Well, my temp at 4 am was 97.2, the day before was 97.9 and the day after was 98.0. So I thought my temp was just messed up b/c I got up so early, and I read that your temp rises .2 every hour. So I just changed to 97.6 ( I know that's wrong, but I just figured that b/c of the day before and the day after, ya know?) Anyway, I put the actual temp in for that day on my tracker today, and guess what! It now shows that I haven't ovulated yet! Suprise, suprise!! At least now I know, although it's been in the back of my head for a while... We'll see what my temps do in the next few days!mrspace- Yes, that would be totally awesome if we started our 2ww together, and got our BFP's together!! Let's just pray this round works for us, and if not, we both have more meds to look forward to! Keep testing with those opk's! I hope you get a +ve soon!! :)",

            "answer": "Hey everyone!Well my temp came back down a little today. Yesterday it spiked to 97.0.\u00a0\u00a0Which was a decent sized spike.\u00a0\u00a0Then today it was back down to 96.4.\u00a0\u00a0 I have a very low normal body temp.\u00a0\u00a0So I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure I'll ovulate today. I want to but I doubt it.\u00a0\u00a0With my temp being down like that.\u00a0\u00a0But I was also told that sometimes you O later than normal when you're on clomid.\u00a0\u00a0So we'll see.\u00a0\u00a0I think we'll be okay with the BD patter that DH and I have had lately.\u00a0\u00a0You'll have to go check it out on my tracker.\u00a0\u00a0 I think it's funny.Other than that, today I'm feeling really bloated and still having a lot of lower back cramping.\u00a0\u00a0But other than that I'm doing great.\u00a0\u00a0See, I've been on and off of anti-depressants since I was 12 years old.\u00a0\u00a0My dad started sexually abusing me when I was 11 and it continued to about 2 years ago, when I turned 20 and finally moved out.\u00a0\u00a0It's been a long hard road so far.\u00a0\u00a0Since we're TTC I can't be on my anti-depressants.\u00a0\u00a0It's a bad time for me to be off of them because I'm finally cutting my dad out of my life.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like it would be easy...but it's not.\u00a0\u00a0I spent years trying to make him happy and to make him love me, even through the abuse.\u00a0\u00a0It's a very hard habit to break.\u00a0\u00a0To this day I still mentally degrade myself on an almost daily basis.\u00a0\u00a0Just because it's what he would do.\u00a0\u00a0And that voice is stuck in my head.\u00a0\u00a0But with DH's help, I'm overcoming it and learning that I'm a good person and that I'm beautiful.\u00a0\u00a0Well, I can't really call myself beautiful yet, but I'm getting there.\u00a0\u00a0But anyway, I've been off of the anti-depressants for 6 months now and the last few days...I haven't needed them!\u00a0\u00a0I have felt really good.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like no big deal but it's huge for me.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I'm at least taking steps in the right direction. Now I just have to stay strong and not deviate from my path.\u00a0\u00a0It's hard. My dad calls me almost every day and leaves me messages about getting together for Christmas and so on.\u00a0\u00a0 It's hard not to call him back.\u00a0\u00a0I still feel like I'm 11 when I talk to him.\u00a0\u00a0Like, if I just do what he wants, maybe he'll love me just a little. But I have to snap out of it.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not 11. I'm 22.\u00a0\u00a0A grown woman.Plus, DH and I made the decision to cut him out now because once there are children involved, everything seems to get \"messier\".\u00a0\u00a0Plus... I could never never never let him be around my children.\u00a0\u00a0The thought just makes me sick to my stomach.So, happy dance for me, that I'm feeling good without medication.\u00a0\u00a0And please, if you don't mind, just keep me in your thoughts with this.Thanks all.Sorry I wrote a book, but I needed to get that off my chest!",

No one deserves what you went through, and you are an amazing person to walk away from that! I'm glad you are feeling better lately, and don't need your anti-depressants! Yay! I took them for a few months after having Kayln, and just when they finally started working, I stopped taking them. You're right, can't take them while ttc! I started to not depend on them, and just concentrated on the love and support I got from everyone around me, just like you have with your dh and us!! :) We love you, and are very, very proud of you!!! ((Hugs)) I hope that +ve opk gets here soon for you! I still have ewcm today, and my temps are still down, so I probably will ovulate soon. By the way, your temps are low the day you ovulate, and then spike the day after indicating that you definately ovulated the day before. So your temps being down today is not a bad thing, you may be ovulating today! :)Stacey- That's great your transfer went well, and they picked the best 2! Yay!!! I love that you got pics of them! I just know this is it for you, and your test is on the 24th! Are you kidding me!? You're going to have the best Christmas EVER!!!! :)Mommyin09- I'm so glad you're back!! We missed you! :)Candie- That's awesome your temps are high today at 7 dpo! I sure hope this is it for you sweetie! :) I'll check out your chart in a minute!Guesito- I'm sorry your new doc is a quack and is mixing up your dates! I'm sure everything is just fine with the baby, and he just is confused because you did invitro! I know it's hard not to worry. I say definately go to your appointment you never cancelled with your old RE, he knows what's going on and knows your dates and everything. I'll be thinking of you, and just have faith! I hope your fears are tossed away after Tuesday! I know it'll be a long weekend for you now, maybe try to call them and see if you can get in earlier?? Tell them your concerns, and i'm sure they'll understand!",

Stay strong, I know how hard this is ((Hugs)) After I had Kayln, I did nothing but take sleeping pills, but not b/c I couldn't sleep, but b/c I didn't want to be awake. Your dream about the tree skirt is adorable! I'm sorry you never found one! :) I know you just want these levels to drop to 0 so you can start healing emotionally/physically and start trying again in a few months. The new year will bring you another baby, I just know it! :)So, Kayln's birthday is wednesday, I can't believe it's already here! :(\u00a0\u00a0A lady that I work with that was always buying Kayln things when I was pregnant gave me her birthday present yesterday! It's an angel leaning on this ball, and it's a solar light. So during the night, her wings and the ball light up. She said it's her angel to look over her at night! :(\u00a0\u00a0I just thought that was sooooo sweet of her to do that! We're all meeting at the cemetary on Wednesday at 3:00 to say a prayer and to wish her a happy birthday. Sean's aunt wrote her a really sweet poem, so I'm going to print it out and laminate it so it can stay out there with her too. It'll be a sad day, but I'm greatful that the whole family will be there to celebrate her birthday with us! I know i'll talk to you all before wednesday, but if you can just remember to keep her in your thoughts I would really appreciate it! :)Well, my temps are still down this morning but I still have ewcm today when I wiped so O must be coming soon! I keep saying/hoping that anyways!! :) I've got my meds just waiting for me, and watch i'll end up pregnant this time and not even need these meds! Wishful thinking!! :) At least I know a few girls here that would be willing to take it off my hands! :)",
