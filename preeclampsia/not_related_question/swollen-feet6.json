            "answer": "Have you been checked at the doctor for preeclampsia? High blood pressure? Protein in urine? Extreme swelling is a symptom. But besides eating less salt....drink LOTS more water. Lay down and stay off your feet when you can. Wear comfortable clothes. DO NOT wear leggings or any other type of tight pants like that when you're at home. Keep your feet elevated, feet above heart. Talk to your doctor about it!",

            "answer": "Okay well if the top number is in the high 120s and your bottom number is under 90 you're okay :) but tell your doctor about it and see what you can do. And YES. It really ***** but soda is not good when you're pregnant :( I made that mistake early on and I always felt like crap. But I have probably one a day, but I make sure to drink lots of water cause caffeine dehydrates you big time! Especially while pregnant. Drink that water and relax your feet and you should start to feel better :)",
