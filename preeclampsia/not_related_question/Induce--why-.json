            "answer": "It's because this is a predominantly US app and the US maternity system is majorly SCREWED. US is 44th in the world for infant mortality, comparable to countries like Serbia, Croatia, Cyprus, Cuba.It means a lot of the maternity care is based on hospital crowding and litigation rather than evidence based practice... Which means doctors are eager to get patients in and out of birthing rooms as quickly as possible, and as medically controlled as possible, rather than as safely as possible. Hence, induction at first chance. Sad state of affairs when mums have to push doctors away (sometimes literally!) just to have a safer birth.",

Some say go natural and wait it out. I didn't and honestly I was too excited to have her at 42 weeks and I don't regret it one bit. But if u can wait it out just wait and let your body do its thing naturally but don't go way too over due !",

            "answer": "@AnnieBrooke have you not read the hundreds of posts on here about medically unnecessary inductions on or before due dates? I think it's happening FAR more than you are letting yourself believe.While it's not for bar exams, the 'medical' reasons are just as flippant and non-research-based - 'big' babies - easily the most common (for goodness sake, one woman's post today is about her doctor inducing her early because her baby is 'too big for her' at 6 pounds), inductions so that baby doesn't swallow poo - what the heck?, because mum is not dilated at 38 weeks and doctor doesn't think she will before she's due (yep, read that one today too), because baby is too small and doctor wants it out to monitor it, because water broke 24 hours ago (72 is quite safe as long as staff keep their dirty fingers out of vaginas), because the doctor wants his weekend kept free because he's golfing. Some talk about routine membrane stripping at 38 weeks, and yet there is a higher stillbirth rate at 38 weeks than 42 weeks. Doctors treat the EDD (ESTIMATED due date) as a deadline to beat, not as a midpoint marker of full term. I can't take it. These are very rare medical reasons that are used on SO many normal women with uncomplicated pregnancies and the induction rate is climbing in the US, not dropping.Inductions bring so many extra risks to birth (especially early induction, and especially for first time mothers). It makes me angry that it's seen as so normal. Especially as the infant mortality rate is so dismal but they keep doing it. I'm just confused as to how you have missed this and think it's declining. Perhaps you're in one of the better states that provide better maternity services (there are a couple out there), in which case, that's awesome, and lucky you!",
