I don't have high FSH which would generally make it simpler to understand why I have a diminished ovarian reserve, but I have high E2 levels which artifically supress my FSH.I was also adviced to take DHEA for 16 weeks in the hopes that it will improve my egg quality. But I have no clue where to begin, where to buy DHEA supplements and what kind to use? Also, I have read that DHEA can have lasting side effects like irreverisble hair loss, which of course has not been confirmed, but I was hoping you guys would know.Are there any side effects? Which brand of DHEA to use?lots of SSBD to you ladies:)))xoxoxoxoJulie",

By March it will be 4 months so maybe if I find the money I'll do one last IVF in April and then I'll know this DHEA really worked.Julie check with your RE they are the ones that determine the dose. I wouldn't have tried the pils without finding out as much as possible from my RE or doctor. They say it doesn't have a lot of side effects except for the hair loss. I have experienced a slight headache if I take my last pill too late in the evening but that's it so far. The website I went on to order my pills is: dhea.com.Good Luck to us all",

            "answer": "This is a long email but I type fast and have alot of info for you ladies.here goes....I started IVF 2 years ago and started DHEA 1 year ago after 3 failed IVF cycles. I now have 10 embryos on ice and am in the middle of what we hope to be our last cycle.After alot of experimentation and mis-steps, our last cycle yielded 10 eggs, 5 were unfortunately immature but the other 5 all fertilized.I had 14 antral follicles at baseline last week and tomorrow is day 6 scan.Couple basics from my experience.1. DHEA works - I recommend to everyone get your DHEA-S and Testosterone levels tested and take DHEA dosage based on those levels. The very low doses being suggested only work if your T is already normal...but most of us with poor response will have low T and need the DHEA. If your T is in the low or below normal range I really recommend 100mg/day.2. Take it in the morning - your body absorbs it in the early morning - first thing when you wake up.3. Test your T level after starting to take the DHEA to ensure that your body is absorbing it and your T level is rising. The goal range is in the high normal or, if you're a REALLY poor responder like me, I shoot to keep it at 100 pg/ml.4. Once you start, your ovaries will become very active. In order to suppress them and get best results, you need the estrogen patch. You WILL OVULATE THROUGH THE PILL. The pill is not enough to suppress your active ovaries. I start the patch right after ovulation, keep it on for 2 weeks, go off for 3 days, then start stims.5. Baseline exam should have E2 less than 30 and at least 8 antral follicles all about 5 mm. You don't want a leader follicle for sure...make sure they're all less than 7 mm. This will be your best circumstance for the investment. DH and I defined our own criteria in baseline after the docs always said....less than 10 looks good to go and we would get different sizes and not enough mature. So we set the rules after that and it has REALLY paid off. Min 8 antral follicles and all about 5 mm. The doc got frustrated when we went 3 months without starting a cycle but I just kept my cool and humor and he was really excited and humbled by the great results we eventually got.6. You will likely need to stim for longer than the usual. I have been stimming for on average 10 days. And the E2 takeoff/major increase, seems to start a bit later. The important thing is how many follicles you see on the follow up scans.Good luck ladies!***@****if you want to email put DHEA only in the subject and I'll pick them up as early as I can.",

I just don't understand what would cause it. Part of me really thinks it is the stress of everything that happened, now compounded with being unable to conceive.

I know how you felt\u2026I felt the same way when I read the published research by Casson and Gleicher in 2000 and 2006 respectively. Be sure to ignore the naysayers sweety. You\u2019ll find them everywhere. My husband calls doctors and nurses technicians instead of scientists. Even my own RE, despite all his support, still doesn\u2019t recommend it outright to new patients. Doctors are most often extremely slow to change and embrace new protocols and they are afraid of doing more harm than good when wading into the abyss.

I\u2019ll look forward to hearing your updates!Blondemacb: I think its fine to take all at once in the morning but work at 100mg first if you go that route. Yes\u2026my back and face broke out\u2026.but scrubbing with those hand scrubby gloves from Target helped somewhat. For you\u2026.I REALLY recommend counting your antral follicles before starting your last cycle. I had DOC scan me on day 15 and day 27 before my period for 3 months. Each month on DHEA I had 2 more until I had 10 antral follicles after my Testosterone had been up consistently for like 2 or 3 months. We were in the same boat as you\u2026..on our last try and couldn\u2019t take a chance of wasting it without seeing a minimum of 8 antral follicles before we said GO. See #12 below about the patch\u2026.this is important for you.BNF:\u00a0\u00a0My Dear you are in a common predicament with many of us poor responders. If you can\u2019t find a high quality doc to take you here\u2019s a suggestion\u2026.challenge your doctor to scan your ovaries on day 20 and 27 of your cycle. Ask if he sees more activity will he reconsider. I promise you my dear he will see more follies and when you do IVF all of your mature eggs will fertilize. I\u2019ve done 3 cycles and every mature egg I\u2019ve gotten has fertilized normally. Also had a friend do the 100mg/day in the am for just a month and she got 4 eggs, all fertilized normally, and she\u2019s got\u00a0\u00a0the BFP! Hang in there\u2026.I would put $$ that you\u2019ll be in another cycle within 2 \u2013 3 months.1.\tDHEA DOES WEAR OFF. I\u2019ve been on high doses for a long time and within 2 weeks of stopping the DHEA altogether my testosterone level returned to its original very low level. My ovarian function has slowed visibly via ultrasound in one month. At this rate I am guessing that 4 \u2013 6 weeks off DHEA after 4 months on it will return you to COMPLETEly original condition.2.\tSTOP DHEA BEFORE EMBRYO TRANSFER. DHEA increases your testosterone and high testosterone is a common cause of miscarriage. This is also reflected in the higher than normal miscarriage rate at CHR when they studied DHEA.3.\tIF YOU DON\u201dT HAVE 4 MONTHS TAKE MORE. In general I don\u2019t think that 25mg 3x/day is going to work for more than 50% of women. If you get eggs and are just improving quality then I think it could be enough. If you get very few or no eggs then I recommend 100mg/day once in the morning. I would not take any more than 150 mg. I have experimented all the way up to 450mg/day and prematurely ovulated despite the proper injections to avoid it.4.\tTAKE IT IN THE MORNING. After much research and my own switch from 3x/day to just the am I believe DHEA is primarily absorbed and converted to DHEA-S in the morning. So I took it 8am daily in my, what I\u2019ll call second phase of experimenting. My Testosterone only then began to rise quite nicely and consistently and antral follicle count increase soon followed.5.\tEMBRYO QUALITY YES, CHROMOSOME QUALITY STILL UNKNOWN. Note \u2013 you can have a normal chromosome setup in an embryo and also have\u00a0\u00a0crappy embryonic (fluid) health. We know DHEA improves the fluid health but its not yet clear if you would get a higher number of PGD quality. Its also interesting to note that miscarriage can be higher with DHEA.6.\tHAIR LOSS IS EXTREMELY RARE. Hair loss can occur with very very high levels of testosterone\u2026.like over 200ng/dl I believe. If you have few or no eggs then you likely have very very low testosterone and DHEA up to 150 mg/day should not raise your testosterone over 120ng/dl. Everyone is different so best to find a doc that will throw in DHEA-S and T to your blood work just to see that you\u2019re not having some strange hyper reaction and getting very high Testosterone levels. These blood tests are very inexpensive.7.\tDHEA BEST WITH ACCUPUNCTURE AND BABY ASPIRIN. Because DHEA increases your testosterone your red blood cell count will increase thus actually thickening your blood. So it is really good to do it with BABY ASPIRIN AND ACCUPUNCTURE to thin the blood a bit and get it over to your ovaries. Poor responders, in conjunction with low testosterone, can also have poor blood supply to the ovaries reducing your response and Accupuncture can take care of that.8.\tTEST TESTOSTERONE AND DHEA-S ON DAY 1-2 & 14, AND ESTROGEN AND FSH ON DAY 1-2. Best if you can get these tests before you start for baseline. After a week on DHEA your DHEA-S should increase significantly, like anywhere from 50 to 100%. It WILL go well above normal but this had no ill effect on me even over 2000ug/dl. Get you lab results printed from your doctor and keep track. Don\u2019t just take the verbal\u2026\u2019you\u2019re above normal\u2026within range\u2026etc.\u2019 you typically get from doc. Track this yourself because the docs do not have a basis in publication for evaluating this data.9.\tBASELINE ESTROGEN GOES DOWN on DHEA. Poor responders typically have elevated baseline estrogen. DHEA can and should cut that elevated level in half after 2 months.10.\tBASELINE FSH GOES DOWN on DHEA. Again..poor responders typically have elevated baseline FSH. I\u2019ll spare you the biochem and just tell you that mine went from 11 to 3.5 and stayed there around 3 while on DHEA. There is a direct correlation between these and increasing your Testosterone level via DHEA.11.\tALCOHOL INTERFERES WITH DHEA-S \u2013 DON\u201dT DRINK AND DO DHEA.12.\tESTROGEN PATCH TO DOWNREGULATE OVARIES BEFORE STIMMING. I ovulated through the pill 2 months straight while on DHEA and the doc wouldn\u2019t believe it until he saw it. Another friend had the same experience. Finally my doc got advice from GLeicher who did the study. The only way to downregulate your ovaries once you\u2019ve gotten higher testosterone from DHEA is the ESTROGEN PATCH. I had to use 2 patches and switch them every day just to keep all the follies at less than 7 mm before stimming.",

However, I looked back at my antrals for the past 7 (wow, it's been that long with 4 iuis and 3 stopped ivfs) and I've had more than 4 only once when I had 9, and that time I only ended up with 1 actually growing. Last time I had 3 antral and 2 grew. I think I'm going to wait and see and hope that I have 3 out of 4...that is the magic number for them going through with an ivf...I need 3 eggs to grow. I'm hoping the DHEA will help.What my biggest concern is is that the center, who is one of the leading fertility clinics around and are really based on research, do not have any experience with dhea. Myself and another woman are the first there. They wouldn't do a blood test for DHEA, stating there wasn't anything they would learn from it. :-( I'm really bummed about that.I just started clomid last night. I've tried every cocktail mix there is thus far. What cocktail mixes worked for you best with DHEA?J",

None of the REs are doing bloodwork because the studies published, other than CASSON in 2000 didn't track blood levels so they have nothing to go on. I tracked my blood for almost 2 years and 4 cycles. Please trust me tracking your blood is important and you need to just be firm and tell them you want it. They will give it to you if you demonstrate determination.\u00a0\u00a0Tell them its very very important to you that they test DHEA-S and Testosterone (T) free and total at least bi-weekly and your FSH and E2 on day 2 of cycle. You will likely find your T in the low range to start. I recommend taking DHEA at doses increasing by 25mg every 2 weeks until you can see your T close to 100ng/dl. And get the lab report print out from them...and track this yourself. This is your money and your baby....I firmly believe you need to find a doctor who will at least allow you to test your DHEA-S and T twice a month until you start your cycle. I rolled over to doctors for 3 cycles and lots of $$ and failure before I finally went on the search for a doctor who would work with me.I just had a transfer yesterday of 2 hatching pgd quality blasts out of 5 tested at age 41. 2 years ago I couldn't even get more than 2 embies past day 3.

This past IVF cycle, with a Clomid/ganirelix cocktail I ended up with only one follicle (later one more sort of appeared that was hazy) and they turned the IVF into an IUI. I have been doing acupuncture religiously along with the DHEA this cycle. They did the IUI on Monday and I'm crossing my fingers and doing a lot of deep breathing. My acupuncturist wants me to try a lot of visualization so I've been scouring the net for fertilization/implantation pictures.Based on some things mentioned, I stopped taking the DHEA however for right now as I had read about the possible miscarriage link. I will start taking it again if this doesn't work out and I will increase my dose to 100. Is that what I should do? What do you recommend?All my doctors still refuse to do any DHEA or testosterone testing, so I'll have to experiment blind. My doctor told me that he no longer feels i am an IVF candidate as I have never had more than 1 or 2 follicles develop to the appropriate size, but wants me to keep trying IUIs or move to a donor.I'm at the point where I just want to try some more alternate options. Doctors don't seem to know much, except for \"hey, here is a new cocktail.\" My doc did agree that if I wanted I could try one more time, possibly on the Femera cocktail which I haven't tried yet. I\"ve tried every other drug combo there is.What drug combos have worked best for you? Good luck on your journey. :-)Jenn",

I can suggest a couple of things for you..a. try going to your regular family physician and ask for a hormone panel. I did this with my physician who was a woman, brought her a print out of the case study by Gleicher of the 42 year old with 60+ frozen embryos, and she was all over it. She gave me blank bloodwork sheets so I could get tests whenever I wanted.b. If the number of follies hasn't increased with 75 mg/day I would definitely increase dosage if this cycle isn't successful. I can tell you that 75mg/day sort of helped for me but when I picked it up increasing about 25mg/month to over 200mg/day I got a cycle with 10 eggs. Turned out 5 were mature and 2 of those were the PGD normal embryos I spoke of last. That puts us at 40% quality. Not too shabby.BUT...before taking ALOT of DHEA....its really important to be sure you're not sending your Testosterone through the roof. If you get pounding heart and shortness of breath your near the ceiling.Hang in there Jenn and let me know how things turn out. :)Hugs for now,Anitasto",

I did experience-earlier ovulation-shortened cycles as short as 24 days from usual 28-lighter and shorter periods.If this is happening I think it is also likely that the DHEA is lowering your base FSH level as that effect also coincided with these symptoms for me. This is a good thing.But I strongly recommend have your day 3 FSH, T, E2 monitored while on DHEA. My E2 went TOO low (because I treat myself like a rat and took more than most) and we managed this by adding the E patch between cycles after ovulation while waitin to start.Go girl! :)Anitasto",

So here goes....Its too curious that your T is in a good range but your FSH is so high, especially for your age.Here's some relative comparisons to your numbers to show your uniquenessMy baseline DHEA was 392 and DHEA-S 66 with T=29 and free T=1.2pg/mL, FSH=10Your (repeating here) is 473 and DHEA-S 78 with T=76 and free T=1.0pg/mL, FSH=15PCOS is more like\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10000 and DHEA-S 700 with T=120 and free T = 7 pg/mL, FSH = 3(the PCOS isn't from any specific data - but you get the idea)Normally, when T is high, FSH is low and vice versa. Because you're not quite fitting this typical spectrum I think you were smart to question and will be wise to look a bit further before adding DHEA.Here's what I would do if I were you......1. Have blood tests on Day 3 for the following hormones (day 21 is also an option if timing is poor and waiting is too hard (I can hardly ever wait myself ;)):ACTH, Cortisol, Dhea, Dhea-s, Androstenedione, T, free T, E2, Estrone, SHBG, IGF-1, EGF as well as Thyroid panel: TSH, T3 and T4All of these hormones are related and a disproprortionate level somewhere in the chain provides excellent pointer to the problem.Testosterone is supported by the Adrenal gland primarily and can also be effected by the thyroid gland.IF your doc says .. 'it's all in the normal range' and you get those good old #s in hard copy to see for yourself (just to be sure and also you can share here ;))....then, ok, I'd start the DHEA but at a low dose like 50mg in the am and test your T after a week. If its already over 100 then lower the dose or reconsider. If not I would probably cautiously move forward and bi-weekly test DHEA-S, T, IGF-1 and FSH twice a month afterward. This is really important I think in your case.Good news is that you're relatively young so if you can quickly focus on figuring this out then there is quite likely a solution and you can then be on your way to the baby farm. ;)I hope you'll post back here and share your findings. I'm really interested to see what the other levels look like and what your doc may have to say. Note - if your doc looks at you dumbfounded which they shouldn't but somehow often seem to.....you're just playing it safe and making sure no stone is left unturned.\u00a0\u00a0You don't want to give up on your babies prematurely.A curious situation unsolved nags at me more than the average person...so I really hope you'll come back.You'll be in my thoughts...Sincerely,Anitasto",

I was pre-med so I have a basic understanding. I'm in nyc where the re's just look at the fsh and response to ivf, so I am going at this on my own. I am expecting my period today and will have all the labs tomorrow an will post back early next week when I have the results. One thing with my history is that I conceived very easily on my own 4 yrs ago, but m/c at 10 wks. My fsh after that was 7. Due to impatience to get pg, I did clomid soon after the m/c which spiked my fsh to 15, changed my cyles (3-5 days of spotting before af) and have been unable to conceive on my own or with ivf. So i do feel I may have some hormonal inbalance that may have been triggered by the clomid. Hopefully the labs will uncover something.

I am glad I found this forum and your messages.I just had my first failed IVF. I had 12 mature eggs retrieved, all fertilized, had 5 growing to 3-day, 3 transferred, other 2 didn't make it to freeze. I am 40 and TTC #1 with my DH. We got married Jan 2007.I got PG the first month we started to ttc around July-07, I didn't know. I was on progesterone that my GYN gave me and I just started to see my RE. He told me to get off progesterone so he could start the fertility workup. I wasn't getting my period so RE did a blood test and found out I was actually PG. I miscarried at 6 weeks. Next normal cycle I took the CCCT and again got PG, I wasn't taking Progesterone. I miscarried at 4 weeks. We did medicated IUI cycle in January-08. Then took a break, started acupunture and chinese herbs for couple of months. Then did our first IVF in June-08. In a nutshell, that is my TTC story.I contacted the NYC clinic (http://www.centerforhumanreprod.com/premature_ovaries.html - discovered, from one of their patient who was taking DHEA to increase oocyte count without telling her doctor) how DHEA helps fertility in older women. I asked them what doses they usually prescribes for patients. They prescribe 50mg in the morning and 25mg at night for average weight women (100MG, 50mg + 50mg for women over 185lbs). Of course they are against shelf-treatment. I ordred DHEA from Belmar Pharmacy, waiting to receive it.I mentioned about that clinic because Regretta from UK asked for a clinic in US who works with DHEA.I will be contacting my primary care doc to order me the hormone panel/blood tests you mentioned. I had a baseline done in September 2007 as part of my fertility workup, and my Testostorone was 86 (normal is between 14-76 I believe). From your research/experience, is that too high to take DHEA?Last blood work on day-3 prior to IVF cycle was in May-08, here are the numbers:Estradiol 25.7Prolactic 18.6FSH 7.39LH 4.7TSH 1.66Thank you again!HQ",

            "answer": "Wow!!! I cannot express how hapy I feel to have found this forum. I have been trying for years. Here is my story.I am now 38 yo. I got pregnant naturally at age 34 but miscarried at week 8 (no heartbeat). A lttle less than a year later I got pregnant on my own again, but the baby (a girl) was diagnosed with a hyplastic right heart (a very rare but serious heart condition that is almost impossible to live with) at week 22 and after much difficult consideration we decided to termiante the pregnancy. A year later i tested with high FSH (9.8) and went for IVF with Gleisher (17 eggs, 7 mature, the 3 that survived transfered on day 3) that tment resulted in a preganncy that was not viable and miscarried on week 6. After that I have undergone 2 more IVF's and a frozen embryo cycle. I generally respond very well to the stimulation ( last cycle I had 19 eggs, 13 fertilized, and after PGD 8 were good, but still no pregnancy) and the Drs. cant explain why I cannot get pregnant. I decided to take a break and do some acupuncture + herbs and maybe let nature take its course. After my last lab test my acupncturist (who is also an MD) prescribed me 50mg of DHEA in the morning These are my results from day 3 June 08:TSH 3rd generation 0.91T4 free\u00a0\u00a01.2FSH 4.4Estradiol <32DHEA Sulfate 134I am worried that the dose might be low or that if I do get pregant I might hurt the pregnancy with the DHEA, What are your thoughts? So far I have been taking it for a week, I do not feel any side effects.What do you think of my DHEA level?Any guidance is well taken, I would reall love your input..ChupsPS: What is so special about the DHEA from Belmar pharmacy?",

Well\u2026.abridged version\u2026.a series of events drove me to find out why I wasn\u2019t having my own kids and solve it or at least have peace in understanding it which would allow me to move on without regrets. I\u2019ll spare you all the details. ;)Where is Casson at? I understood him to have left Oregon but couldn\u2019t find him during my research when I had questions.3 months is a good period of time agreed. But I will note here that my best results came in just one month\u2019s time when I upped my dose. Also, there are a couple studies out on Testosterone patch in which women go from an average of 2 eggs to 8 eggs in a cycle and 26%\u00a0\u00a0success in the group. That led me to conclude that it wasn\u2019t necessarily a time factor as a dosing factor and I still think that. However, for the very best situation, eggs do take 3 months from their very initial selection to ovulation so its reasonable to assume it\u2019s a good thing and this time factor would be more likely to contribute to the improved chromosomes.Hope you had a great 4th weekend!Anitasto",

            "answer": "Q: Can DHEAQ be harmful or detrimental to a cycle?A: Yes \u2013 Great question and glad you asked. And this is most important. In lab rats high doses of DHEA have converted all normal females to PCOS females. In my last 2 months of DHEA I took A LOT of DHEA and, sure enough, my LH went high and ruined the last cycle which only resulted in 2 eggs, neither of which survived the thaw. I don\u2019t want to write a book here but just to say\u2026.keep track of your Testosterone and LH, start at the 75 mg in the morning and increase gradually not more than 25mg more/2 weeks until you see what it does. 25mg can make a big difference. If you can get your T between 80 to 120 for a month before your cycle then you\u2019ll rock.Q: I'm assuming I would have to tell my RE that I had been taking DHEA so they could supress early ovulation?A: Short answer \u2013 Yes. Make sure he\u2019s doing LH tests along with the E2 from the beginning. And just so you can evaluate for yourself\u2026an LH greater than 1.0 is enough to cancel a cycle. The ideal upper limit before HCG is 0.7 There are studies on or related to this by Fleming, 2000; Coppola, 2003, Ferrari, 2004.I think my reward is due too and hope like heck it works.

At first I was jumping to complicated reasons for miscarriage when it hit me.Your numbers demonstrate a perfect baby making machine and you have gotten pregnant on your own three times in what...4 months?......why do you have an RE who's suggesting IVF? And the fact you didn't get pregnant even with your cycle makes me wonder if your stress level got high because of IVF (stressful stuff!)Gosh...if I could give you a hug I would.If I were in your shoes I would1. take baby aspirin - some studies believe it increases conception and reduces miscarriage by up to 50%.2. get your progesterone checked shortly after ovulation. If its low, throw on the supplements. Even if they're mid-level it won't hurt.3. get a couple of tests for blood clotting which causes recurrent early and sometimes late term miscarriage. The treatment for these is heparin.4. take no more than 25mg dhea if you feel srongly about it...it won't hurt but taking more in your case, especially if you do have blood clotting issue would not be so good.5. start accupuncture for fertility weekly. its fantastic for reducing stress AND making sure your blood flows to nourish fertility. But I think it really helped me being older and so anxious to get our kiddos.6. read this thread on heparin treatment for recurrent miscarriage. Blood clotting is a common cause of recurrent miscarriage and there are several different reasons for having blood that really likes to clot. Do you get clots commonly in your period???http://www.pregnancy-info.net/QA/answers-Using_Heparin_during_pregnancy_/7. I would definitely get tested for autoimmune antibodies. I'm not so much an expert on this but...I am getting tested for Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome (APS) which causes blood clots due to unusual antibodies that interact with proteins. My dad has blood clots as well as an uncle and they've been on Cumadin for over a decade. Studies indicate it runs in families though they haven't nailed down the gene.Note - I have a girlfriend who had 4 consecutive early miscarriages before starting aspirin and succeeding.Would love to hear how things develop for you....and I really hope you can be successful the good old fashioned way. It seems like you have great potential for it!Sincerely,Anita",

More follicles appeared..up to 16 follicles during stim if I trust the scan\u2026but my E2 climbed slow and all were I think 15 \u2013 22mm at HCG.

Doing PGD is so great \u2026.it helped us to know we could make great embryos and truly minimize risks later. But, like you, we didn\u2019t get pregnant with them. My heart really goes out to you. What a roller coaster you\u2019ve been on.I don\u2019t really think DHEA is the crux of your problem but it wouldn't hurt to test your Testosterone level. DHEA-SO4 of 181 is in normal range but there is room for it to go up. If you do start it, I would keep it to 25mg. Your baselines are so good and your FSH already so low that more than this could create other problems for you.How thick was your lining before transfer?How many transfers have you done?There\u2019s another post here .. a woman who was miscarrying\u2026HQ2007. check out the response to her post.At the end of the day I want the baby and the fastest way to her or him. So when my PGD quality embies didn\u2019t work in me I felt a surrogate could short circuit a potentially long path figuring out that part of it and I couldn\u2019t spend the time.Ironically, the attorney who educated me about surrogacy had a similar story. She did IVF over and over, got pregnant and miscarried. After 3 of those she worked with a surrogate and has twins from first try.I\u2019m not trying to advocate here\u2026just offer a potential option for a really challenging situation. In the meantime\u2026.I\u2019d check the bloodclotting issues, low low dose DHEA, and if you get a positive test for one of those issues heparin\u2019s the next step. As you\u2019ll see in HQ\u2019s response, there\u2019s some good possibilities for miscarriage issues.I\u2019ll be thinking of you and truly hope your next try is end of your rainbow\u2026gold and all. \uf04aOh \u2013 dhea from a pharmacy is generally a compounding pharmacy so efficacy is more consistent and reliable.-Anita",

With FSH reduced your baseline E2 is reduced also...though other hormones effect E2 this is the most relevant I think for DHEA. That's one reason I think a low dose of DHEA is good to start with when your baseline E2 is already pretty good. But your DHEAS will go up to a healthy level I think before it effects baseline E2I know...long answer. I gotta work on that. :)Hope this helps.Cheers,Anita",

            "answer": "Thank you so very much for your answer!!!! I cannot tel you how I wish my Dr would interact with me the way you do with us... Your knowledge is amazing, so especific and detailed!! WOW!So far I have had 4 transfer (3 fresh cycles and 1 frozen, I still have two frozen embryos). As far as I know my lining has been fine, \"beautiful\" to use Drs. words! ( i believe that it was 14 mm thick or maybe 7, cant remember...) 1 of the transfers was a bioquemichal pregnancy and the other resulted in a miscarriage at week 6. But again, i dont think my dr. was concerned about that because he thought my problem was that my eggs were not good.In any case my acupuncturist/MD also had me test for the antiphospholipid AB panel and the results were low positive titers... (especifically the Cardiolipin was out of range , slightly elevated...) He explained that it meant that my blood was thicker and that it could be related to miscarriages, for this he recomended the baby aspirin which I have been taking...Anyway thanks again for your support.Good luck to all potential moms..Chups",

I express concern here because DHEA will thicken your blood further. And while I think its a reasonable step for you, it also would make me want to track the RBC to ensure its ideal or in the low range and stays there and if not you can determine you should introduce heparin.Make sense?And glad you like my long answers.

HOWEVER - almost all labs have different reference ranges (though I've never heard of <10 in any unit or lab as normal - but first time for everything). SO you really need the full report so you can also see the units and reference range.And let me just confirm - you've never been pregnant right? I didn't see it in your post but just want to make sure I'm not missing a big zinger in here.Hope we hear back! :)Cheers,Anitasto",

Interesting that my testosterone and dhea-s levels went down. (Last month they were 76/78 on day 21). I'm not sure if the testosterone was elevated from the stims I did last month. Do you see anything that would need more work-up? Should I start dhea? Would you recommend 25/d and recheck levels next month? Again, I really appreciate your feedback and insight. Thanks!",

            "answer": "Well, I'm on day 3 of stimming (Angela SK07- sounds like we're on the same cycle timing!) and day 47 of DHEA (started at 25mg and worked my way up to 100mg per day).My CD3 b/w came back with a lower FSH (yeah!) at 5.7 and higher E2 at 115.\u00a0\u00a0These are consistent numbers with what I've had pre-DHEA (though when I'd had FSH that low and E2 that high I always had left over /unruptured follies from the prior cycle).\u00a0\u00a0Interestingly the nurse commented that the high E2 is an indication that FSH is artificially masked lower than what it should really be (and since they tested me last CD3 with FSH of 15.0 they know current history).\u00a0\u00a0Note - RE does not know I'm taking DHEA.\u00a0\u00a0Regardless the cause (and I'm cautiously thanking DHEA), I'm happy to see lower FSH since (purely anecdotally) it seems women with 'normally' high FSH tend to have better IVF cycle success when their FSH is lower during their cycle month.Also good - my CD3 u/s showed a 'conservative' 8+5 follies less than 10mm with no evident dominant follie and no left-overs (RE said there may be more than 5 on the left ovary but was counting conservatively).\u00a0\u00a0These counts are on the higher side for me (best I've had before with no prior cycle left-overs was a total of 8 follies).So I go back Friday to see the results of stims. I've been on Estrace since mid-last-cycle and now am on 450 iu follistim, 15cc low-dose HCG, plus baby aspirin.\u00a0\u00a0The stim dose is on the high side (but 'normal' for me based on prior cycles; always do better with higher doses).Anitasto -- I really appreciate your input and suggestions on tests I should get.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, since my RE doesn't know about the DHEA I don't feel at liberty to ask for extensive testing, so have had DHEA support testing done at my OB-GYN (they will do the testing but also important, insurance covers with them and not the RE).\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately I wasn't able to get in to get the tests on CD3 so am \u2019flying blind\u2019 taking the DHEA for this cycle at least.\u00a0\u00a0As for FSH levels on DHEA -- I probably wasn't clear, the 13.6 FSH I had tested was almost 1 year ago (so I don\u2018t really have a current baseline FSH prior to starting DHEA).\u00a0\u00a0My recent cycle info is:6/16/08 CD3: FSH=15.0, E2=35, LH=3.3, PG=0.6 (DHEA for 23 days 25mg worked to 75mg)7/08/08 CD3: FSH=5.19, E2=115, LH=1.7, PG=0.4 (DHEA for 45 days; 100mg since 6/17/08)So a question for anyone:\u00a0\u00a0The low-dose HCG is a new med for me this cycle, what is the purpose?Thanks all for your input and support!!!",

Your labs are almost identical to mine....classic poor responder. If it were me in your shoes, I would go forth on 75mg/day of the DHEA, test on CD3: T, DHEA-S, E2, FSH and CD21: T and DHEA-S. Once you're sure its going up then you'll want to avoid platea. If you plateau with T less than 80 then add another 25mg every 2 weeks until you're sitting in the 80 - 120 range.If you're trying to get PG naturally I'd choose the 80 end and if IVF I'd choose the 120 end of that range and then reduce a bit after the cycle.As for previous higher T reading, there are many things that can raise and lower your T. I'd just get T and DHEA-S checked as above and make sure things progress as expected.\u00a0\u00a0If you want to do more tests.... I also tracked....SHBG went down and IGF-1 went up...but within normal or close to normal limits. My DHEA-S was 1854 after 3 mos at 100mg DHEA/day. That was when we really started to see more follies.BTW - have you ever had a successful pregnancy? While miscarriages are common, I only had one m/c before I learned about the antibody syndrome issues....which cause m/c. I'll do a separate post on that for everyone in a few days once I can reach the expert. I'm just learning about it and wish I'd known before my failed cycles as there are things we can do.I'm excited for you and glad things are all where they are!Look forward to hearing your progress! :)Anitasto",

But with your E2 that high I also would be concerned about a leftover unruptured follies though glad to hear they're all under 10.In any case....allow me to add a tale of history for you here....You see, on DHEA your ovaries become very very active and they produce large follicles like jelly beans once your T is high. So downregulating and ensuring there are no large follies before you stim is really important.\u00a0\u00a0I ultimately required 2 Estrogen patches daily to keep them quiet for 2 weeks before stimming.Sounds like you're doing really great and I'm really excited for you!Anitasto",

Sounds like your doc is up on his stuff. ;)fun fact - you can use an ovulation predictor test to also test pregnancy because it picks up the HCG as if it were LH.

Due to financial concerns, my DH and I decided to pursue a path of natural conception and have been with my new OB since Feb./March cycle!\u00a0\u00a0(NaPro technology, if anyone's interested!)Anyway, this past cycle, he did a complete hormonal profile - I went in for b/w every other day for Estradiol checks and then once ovulation was confirmed, Estradiol and Progesterone.\u00a0\u00a07DPO, he did a range of tests, one of which was DHEA.I had read various things about the correlation of DHEA and fertility and was doubly curious due to my diagnosis of sub-clinical hypothyroidism. (Knew that they were connected somehow...) However, I was very uncomfortable with self-medicating on this particular hormone and wanted to trust the advice of people caring for me (my OB, chiropractor and my acupuncturist)So, my DHEA came in at 95, to which the doc said 'it's on the low side.'\u00a0\u00a0He wants to see it in the 200's.\u00a0\u00a0He prescribed DHEA (which I get from a Compounding Pharmacy, so they make it there and it's PURE DHEA) at 25 mg once a day.\u00a0\u00a0I will also get this re-tested tmw, so I'll let you know if there has been any change.I was chatting with my acupuncturist about how I have instantly responded to the DHEA (more energy, less depression, lessened fibromyalgia symptoms) and I was telling her about this post and my re-check tmw.\u00a0\u00a0She said to be sure that testosterone was being re-checked because it needs to stay low in order to not affect your uterine lining and thin it out, preventing implantation.\u00a0\u00a0I told her that I had read that some women were taking upwards of 75 mg per day of DHEA and she was IMMEDIATELY concerned.She said that was a very high dosage (per her, 25 is standard for women and 50 is standard for men)....she said that at that dosage, testosterone checks should be happening because DHEA can raise it and counter the very thing that we are trying to accomplish.I just thought that I would share the information as I received it!\u00a0\u00a0Sorry for the long post!Thanks!",

Can you share with us? Its amazing that your FSH is 3 something...low... while your DHEA is also low. For me and others in here its typically DHEA Low and FSH mid to high.Your accupuncturist is right that your T should be tracked. My lining was slightly effected on very high dhea and high T. With dhea of 95 pg/ml (if it was tested in the am)...i suspect your dhea-s and testosterone are also very very low and should be checked to be sure. DHEA itself is unstable in your system but DHEA-S is very stable and can be tested any time of day.A great article to see the typical blood values when dhea is added is Casson's study in 2000 with dhea and ivf. You can google for it or if you like I can send it to you if you send your email.Hope you'll let us know how things are going and keep us posted.Happy baby making! :)Anitasto",

DHEA may be transformed into testosterone, estrogen or other steroids. It is found in the body as DHEA or in the sulfated form known as DHEA-S. One form is converted into the other as needed.Cortisol and DHEA are among the hormones produced by the adrenal glands. It is possible that these hormones can reduce the immune system dysfunction seen in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. More studies are needed, but taking these medications appropriately carries little (if any) risk and can markedly improve the patient's function and overall health.",

I'm sorry I didn't mention it earlier but I'm always a little reluctant to throw out a curve when there's already so much to keep straight in a cycle. I know others don't generally do that but I just went from my blood levels working to keep my T around 100pg/ml.Soooo....yes....I think its worth testing your DHEA-S and T just to see whats happening.Did you get a scan today? How many follies did you see?Also, it sounds like you're on estrogen during your ivf cycle? Is that right? Asking because I've never heard of that.I'll check back soon - eager to hear how things are going.Anitasto",

If you need them I can send a copy if you want to give your email.After your RE has had a chance to read them (ask him to read them and get back to you..) if he doesn't suggest DHEA then you might just say... \"I'd like to try it. Can we check my DHEA-S and Testosterone and go from there?\" Your RE should be supportive unless he can point to some very specific reason he dosen't think it will work for you.Other women go to their gynecologist or regular PCP and ask for the tests which avoids any potential conflict with your re.Best of luck,Anitasto",

My stats are:Tue\t7/8/2008\tCD3/Stim1: FSH=5.19, E2=115, LH=1.7, PG=0.4, RO=8<10, LO=5<10Fri\t7/11/2008\tCD6/Stim4: E2=164, RO=6<10, LO=3<10Mon\t7/14/2008\tCD9/Stim7: E2=102 (drops off Estrace), RO=12,10,1<10; LO=1<10Wed\t7/16/2008\tCD11/Stim9: E2= , RO=15,11,2<10; LO=10,1<10I was probably premature to start another cycle having been on DHEA only 6 weeks, so I am 'consoling' myself that if we scrap this cycle because of low counts, it's not the end of the world (a little $ out of pocket for meds and tests, but not the big bucks of a full IVF try).\u00a0\u00a0And another 4 weeks on DHEA can only help right?\u00a0\u00a0That said, I'm not completely writing this cycle off.\u00a0\u00a0But will put my ducks in a row to do another round of blood tests (all those you mentioned before) if I get to another CD3.\u00a0\u00a0It would be so much easier to have an RE work with me on this rather that going to my OB-GYN for tests, but I hope at least my experience will benefit others in the future going to this RE!Oh, a question:\u00a0\u00a0you said you were having DHEA-S and T tested every other day when cycling.\u00a0\u00a0When I had my DHEA and DHEA-S blood tests for baseline it took a week to get the results back - is that abnormal?\u00a0\u00a0(Just wondering how/if you were getting results back so quickly)Also -- you said you had fewer follies on 3 cycles.\u00a0\u00a0What did you do?\u00a0\u00a0Was this before DHEA or during and did you end up scrapping the cycles?Thanks again!Lynne",

So that RE's guess about my \"high T\" was completely off-base.Unless your RE actually tested your \"male hormone\" levels he has no basis to state what your male hormone level may be.\u00a0\u00a0If he won't test your levels go to your OB-GYN or your family dr. (Anitasto has provided great info on basic 3 tests to get).If you feel you need an explanation for requesting the tests - you can always tell them your acupucturist wants to put you on DHEA for fertility but from what you've read you'd feel more comfortable understanding what your levels are before actually starting any supplements.Good luck!Lynne",

Estrogen should be used to downregulate before a cycle (the pill or patches) only\u2026and in some cases after transfer as new studies indicate this increases PG rates.

            "answer": "This is a long post \u2013 but I\u2019ve spent much time considering and trying these and this has really all the best advice I can offer to get your bloodwork (preferably with the same person who\u2019s doing your cycles). So please bear with and read thru.HERE ARE SOME QUICK AND EASY CHECKS YOU CAN DO TO FIND SUPPORT FOR DHEA BLOODWORK................Call accupuncturists in your area that specialize in fertility. My local fertility acupuncturist knows every RE in this town backward and forward because she works with them. I imagine its similar in most towns.Post on this blog the town you live in and ask for referrals from gals here. You could get very lucky. I\u2019m in San Diego and can offer great resources here.Contact your PCP and let them know you're situation and ask if they can check adrenal function with DHEA-S, T (free and total) with day 3 fertility panel FSH, E2, LH. Most PCPs are pretty agreeable with this and tests are inexpensive. But they will order they're own stuff - so be sure to tell them what you want specifically.ON TRYING TO FIND AN RE WHO WILL DO DHEA REALATED BLOODWORK.......Imagine this analogy - humor me here...You\u2019re in a delicate dance with a big hungry bear (yes...he wants your ivf $$). If you remain calm and make just the right steps, you can get the bear to dance with you. If you appear aggressive or turse\u2026.well\u2026.the bear will eat you and move on. If you are too meak and play dead...well... the bear will not be interested in you, walk over you and then walk away. I hate to say it....but this is life. And this is how I\u2019ve felt in searching for an RE and even working with him until we struck the right balance of mutual respect. And that took six months of displaying consistent calm but determination.In trying to get RE cooperation (not support \u2013 you\u2019re unlikely to find it) it\u2019s really important to back up your requests with good research. They will take you much more seriously.If you want to try with your current RE I would fax or deliver a copy of Casson on DHEA and IVF in 2000 (free on inet), Gleicher on DHEA in 2005 and 2006 (the case study of one woman with 66 embryos and the followup study with 26 or so women on DHEA.) If you need copies post your email and I\u2019ll send them all to you. Otherwise Casson is free online and Gleicher's are about $5 I think as a patient. Ask your doctor to review those and ask if you can talk with him in about a week. This gives you time to check around so you have backup if you need it.In the meantime\u2026.CONTACT REs AND ANY OTHER ENDOCRYNOLOGIST YOU CAN FIND CLOSE TO HOME - ESPECIALLY WITH FOCUS ON FERTILITY (many do thyroid and diabetes only). Antiaging is also pretty good...these folks seem to be most well rounded in their understanding of the endocrine system.ASK FOR A PHONE CONSULT. Almost all of them give free phone consults or some have a set fee for a consult\u2026.they do them all the time.OTHER RESOURCES................Also contact any PCP who is a woman especially in her 40s. Most of these will likely be kindred spirits in your plight and willing to help. But like Garden, having to see 2 different doctors is not ideal unless you just have a lot of time. But even then, it will wear on you eventually.HOW TO ASK...WHAT TO SAY...IMPORTANT TONE AND APPROACHAnd a very important thing I think\u2026.. I would really avoid asking what any RE or other doctor what they think about DHEA if I were you. You will get as many different answers as there are REs and once they\u2019ve stated a negative opinion it is very hard for them to save face and agree to help you. Asking their opinion just opens the door to conflict when your opinions differ.After telling them about your failed cycles and sincere desire to have your own children\u2026I would only say \u201c\u2026..I am planning to use DHEA and would so much appreciate if you will be able to add bloodwork for DHEA-S and T prior to and during the cycle. Is this something you can do?\u201dI write this script because the wording is really important here. You\u2019re not asking what they think or what they are willing to do. You\u2019re asking if they \u2018can\u2019\u2026which the answer of course is yes\u2026they can do anything they want.\u00a0\u00a0If they say no then they simply don\u2019t want to do it and that\u2019s ok too and best to find out early. You WILL find support with this sweet, kind, educated and sincere request. If you strike out more than twice\u2026I would even be willing to make calls on your behalf. I mean this seriously.ON AN RE WHO HAS ALREADY SPOKEN NEGATIVELY ABOUT DHEA.........When you talk again with your RE and he says he has read the articles (which you sent and asked him to review) but is not comfortable or anything negative which you should expect\u2026. then I would say\u2026.\u201c....I really appreciate your taking the time to talk with me further and I do understand\u00a0\u00a0this is different from what we discussed. I would really like to try this next if you could allow me to do that. Would you be willing to consider Gleicher\u2019s protocol?\u201dIf he agrees to this\u2026..you\u2019re home. And in this case you have to say \u2018willing\u2019 because he\u2019s already stated a position so you are in fact asking him to bend and recognizing it. This will give you \u2018humble\u2019 points and make it difficult to refuse you.CONSIDER PRACTICING YOUR APPROACH AHEAD OF TIME.......If you have a difficult time taking a position like this\u2026e.g. you\u2019re generally shy or avoid conflict at all cost or are intimidated by doctors (most of us are)\u2026then practice these scripts with DH or a girlfriend. Same goes if you tend to run the other way...bull in a china shop...\u00a0\u00a0;) And if you have a confident and diplomatic friend, consider asking them to call on your behalf. This is probably not necessary but I've been asked by a few girlfriends at different times to go with them to REs and other important stuff to advocate and its always been an honor to help them get what they need.I think it is so very important to find the support you need in order to ensure you are getting successful outcome with DHEA. Most can do well without it but you don't want to be the one who really needs it and waste time. DH and I spent 6 months without DHEA, 4 more months without good support, and then had DHEA complications that took a year to figure out that we never would have without bloodwork support. As many of you know, we did get 10 eggs in a cycle on DHEA .... 2 1/2 years earlier in our first IVF we only ever saw 1 follicle.I sincerely hope you ladies find this helpful.All the best,Anitasto",

Cycle 2 was also cancelled.\u00a0\u00a0Cycle 3 we had determined that I had poor ovarian response, though my FSH readings at the beginning of a cycle are all normal - in fact I was told that all my hormone levels are normal at the beginning, but my E is slow to rise during a cycle and I just seem to have a low follicle count on every cycle.\u00a0\u00a0Cycle 3 we had 8 follicles, and retrieved 6 eggs. Only 3 could be ICSI'd - 2 of those fertilised abnormally and the final one was graded poor and didnt get past 5 cells.\u00a0\u00a0I was scared that the quality was all so poor and we were told to prepare ourselves for never having our own children, though not to give up all hope yet.My Dr then put me on DHEA - I havent had my levels tested however I can say that we then started another cycle after only 1 month on the DHEA - sadly we only got 4 eggs - I was devastated - but all 4 fertilised normally and all 4 got to blastocyst stage (though 2 were too slow to get to PGD testing in time).\u00a0\u00a02 were good enough to be PGD tested on day 6, 1 passed the PGD and was transferred - unfortunately no BFP but what a difference from cycle 3 to cycle 4.\u00a0\u00a0I am now back on the DHEA and will also do an oestrogen priming protocol this cycle.\u00a0\u00a0I am also about to start acupuncture.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure if any of you have any suggestions - my Dr says that adding the oestrogen priming is the last trick in her book - however I am hopeful that if we just keep on going that we will get there eventually.\u00a0\u00a0I am not exactly sure how the Oestrogen priming helps?I am also interested in whether DHEA can increase or decrease miscarriage rates and notice that the CHR state that their research shows as follows:'This is why the timing of the arrival of the Toronto data was so exciting; these data not only confirmed the high pregnancy rate in very unfavorable patients with diminished ovarian reserve, but demonstrated an identical reduction in miscarriage rate to the one observed by us (when compared to national IVF data). Since the combined data sets between CHR and the Toronto center involve an adequate size patient sample, we are now confident to state that DHEA supplementation significantly decreases the miscarriage rate in women with diminished ovarian reserve.'http://www.centerforhumanreprod.com/premature_ovaries.htmlDoes anyone know anything about DHEA and miscarriage rates - ie if I manage to get to transfer again do I stop taking the DHEA or not, and if I stop - when should I stop????",

I'd have to go back through the post to be sure, but I believe it was Anitasto that wrote that CHR had a higher miscarriage rate because they left people on DHEA through transfer up to the first or second positive beta.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure what the right answer is - I've read Dr. Gleicher at CHR state that \"There is no evidence to suggest that DHEA is harmful. PCOD patients, who get pregnant all the time, have very high DHEA levels.\u00a0\u00a0Pregnancy, itself, is a high DHEA state since the placenta is a DHEA factory.\" (so presumable supplementing into the early pregnancy shouldn't be a problem).\u00a0\u00a0But I'm inclined to take the conservative approach and follow Anitasto's advise that DHEA supplementing be ended with transfer since it tends to increase a woman's testosterone and high T can lead to m/c (or at least pull back on the amount taken... then again if you're getting blood tests throughout your cycle like Anitasto suggests, you'll know what your T levels are and make an assessment whether there is a risk of high T / continuing DHEA).(Note - the comments from Dr. Gleicher were from a phone consult a woman on IVFconnections.com had with him in 2005 and posted to that board; she reconfirmed that info with him again in May this year.)",

Animal studies have shown that DHEA is very effective in preventing breast cancer, while the human studies have been inconclusive. There are studies showing that DHEA protects against human breast cancer cell proliferation by blocking estrogen receptors on breast cells, yet other studies contradict this finding.As for estrogen increasing on DHEA, I am still in a different camp, but everyone\u2019s body is different. In my experience my E2 initially increased at baseline but was always associated with either late luteal cyst or early developing follicle. Once this was under control with downregulation, my baseline E2 averaged 40pg/mL when ovaries were quiet.Also, increased estrogen and BC association are peri or post menopausal as far as I understand the research.I\u2019d be very interested to read what you\u2019re referring to that says DHEA increases BC risk.

Sasparilla posted \u201cI had to stim longer than most people, b/c my E2 levels were sooooooo slow to rise, but at the end I had 11 eggs/all 11 were mature and 9 fertilized. \u201c It\u2019s slow but it does jump.Why E2 rise slower? I could speculate or theorize but it\u2019d be long and I\u2019d rather save it for more research when I have more time. ;) Sorry.ESTRACE BEFORE STIMULATION was very important for me to downregulate and was recommended by CHR. But the follicles in the early stages are primarily composed of Testosterone and then convert to Estrogen around size 7-8mm. E and T impact each other negatively\u2026e.g. T goes up, E goes down and vice versa. I read this and found it in my own bloodwork.6 weeks on DHEA is a good start \u2013 how much are you on?Great to hear you didn\u2019t need the Ganirelix. It slowed my folly growth and made my cycle longer\u2026.and \u2026. in retrospect my RE had me on it without Progesterone bloodwork. Hmmm\u2026wish I\u2019d have thought of that before. Glad you posted it.ESTRACE DURING STIMS \u2013 I just can\u2019t find ANYTHING! I\u2019ve searched and searched. If it were typical or normal there would be SOMETHING I believe. I\u2019ve researched lots of protocols and just never heard of this. Estrogen is always used to downregulate. Think of the pill. If I were you I honestly just wouldn\u2019t use it other than to downregulate. PUGLIES - HELP HERE?DOSAGE & BW - I honestly think you should get your new bloodwork and see where your DHEA-s and T are. I went back thru my notes from you to see if anything stuck out. Your baseline DHEA and DHEA-s were extraordinarily low.DHEA 46\u00a0\u00a0DHEA-S 1.7. My baseline was DHEA 392 and DHEA-S 66. My acceptable range from labcorp\u00a0\u00a0is DHEA 135 \u2013 810 and DHEA-s 40 \u2013 325.Mine was higher than yours and lower than those in Casson\u2019s study and my first real IVF results came on 150mg/day but I was tracking my T. You want your T to be around 100 I believe based on my experience.I\u2019ll be interested to hear what your levels are now. Can you repost them with your original baseline, time and dosage on dhea, and current levels? I think this would be so helpful for others here.Hang in there my dear! The fact that you have some changes is good \u2013 just need to figure out the tweeks and you will get there. For some it comes like butter but I had to do some tweeking and it appears if you keep with it you\u2019ll get there. Just know you\u2019re not alone and I feel confident for you that it will happen if you can get your BW, right dosage, and right protocol (thinking sans estrace).Keep us posted my dear. :)Sincerely,Anitasto",

            "answer": "Hope02,Hi Hope. And welcome also. I\u2019m sooo excited to hear another doctor freely adding DHEA. Sounds like your in great hands.A couple things from your post along with other posts on estrogen sent me searching\u2026..And here\u2019s the thing, just like estrogen during stims I didn\u2019t find a study but on estrogen priming I did find some blogs. Here\u2019s a quote from one, \u201cI talked to the nurse at Dr. Swanson and asked her if they do estrogen priming as part of the antagonist protocol.\u00a0\u00a0She said no, they used to, but they weren't getting a good response.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Her doc is proposing estrogen priming by taking it 4 weeks before stimming. Here\u2019s the link: http://wombmatewanted.typepad.com/blog/estrogen-priming/index.htmlMy theory on estrogen priming is that with DHEA its critical to downregulate the ovaries for 2 weeks, starting immediately after ovulation, just before stimming. I don\u2019t like the 4 weeks of estrogen because then you don\u2019t ovulate so your ovaries don\u2019t get LH which is important to the health of future follicles. I once did Estrogen for 3 weeks instead of 2 for scheduling purposes and follies started disappearing after 12 days of Estrogen so I wouldn\u2019t do it again. Also, CHR \u2013 which started this whole thing after Casson \u2013 uses 2 weeks on Estrogen patches prior to stims, 3 days off everything but baby aspirin and vits, then stims \u2013 this worked for me very well.We\u2019ve had different approaches on this blog to going off and staying on DHEA after transfer. If I were to go again, I would just cut my DHEA down to 50mg after retrieval and 25mg after PPT. Some quit after retrieval all together, some quit after 2 ppt. My email on this question to CHR got a response that they do not stop the DHEA supplements after transfer.As for miscarriage. I think its pretty straightforward. Most of us see better quality eggs and embryos on dhea. It thus should follow that there should be fewer miscarriages.Its easy to worry about everything \u2013 but the acupuncture will definitely help you relax. I think it sounds like you\u2019re going to do really just fine in this next cycle given your fert rate this time.BTW \u2013 DH and I did pgd without PG results. We are doing 3 day xfer next time. Most dhea\u2019ers are doing 3day xfers. Just a thought.Finally - I think your instincts are right \u2013 keep doing what you\u2019re doing and just get your bloodwork to see that your T is close to 100 and you have increased number of antral follies before starting stims to be sure you $$ are being very well spent.Looking forward to hearing how it all goes!Sincerely,Anitasto",

Thanks for sharing the greek study....fantastic!I was thinking about your situation and feel a little concerned that your FSH is so very high and going off HRT. I think in your case more than most it is critical that you get a hard copy of all your bloodwork before stopping HRT and get baseline DHEA, DHEA-S and T before starting DHEA as well as typical day 3 panel.What are your taking for HRT? I'm curious because this is new to me.I don't mean to create concern for you....just want to encourage doing this with full knowledge because frustration can (and has for me) drive us to make big steps which are usually good....but just take care to be stepping in the right direction. ;)Thanks so much for joining and sharing!

            "answer": "I keep having afterthoughts about you....it must be the wine! hehe.Your LH levels are slightly concerning. The gold standard as I understand it based on many studies is that LH should be between 0.5 and 1.7 at HCG injection before retrieval. Yours fortunately appears to be going down on CD 3 while you're on DHEA. But it should be lower on CD3....like below 0.5. And this now also leads me to question the use of HCG in your cycle. I could understand if your LH was 0.0 and never went up, but if he's adding HCG and then also adding Ganirelix to avoid ovulation its kind of chicken and the egg. Make sense?I'd just get your labs like you do and follow that LH and don't add that HCG if your LH is over 0.5 and once you see 0.7 definitely start the ganirelix.Here's a link that lists the studies and their standards.http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/12/1/3/T8?ck=nckHere's the best study I think....http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/12/1/3?ck=nck#T8Let me know your thoughts. My last cycle had LH of 5+ and our eggs were ****. That's the problem with high LH. I seriously regretted allowing my doc to do the retrieval knowing the LH and responsibly he should have canceled it. Ugh!Sweet dreams my fellow blogmeister. ;)Anitasto",

Thanks!BTW - Did you see follicles in your 3 cycles or was it focused on prep. for Xfer?Also - here's an idea that 'could' give you an early indication of whether you'll respond to DHEA...DHEA converts primarily into testosterone which does all sorts of things to cause your ovaries to produce follies. There is a great study that uses only the Testosterone patch for POF women and they went from 1-2 follies to 8 eggs on average at retrieval and 26% PG.Here's the link:\u00a0\u00a0 http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/21/7/1884If DHEA is going to work for you then its possible a short quick route just to test it would be to use a T patch according to the study, and just see if you can see follicles.Also, women with severe POF are often put on Testosterone to sustain bone density.If that works .... it should be a good indicator of whether DHEA will work and you don't have to wait months to find out. In the study the patch was put on shortly after PD begun for I think 4 days and...boom...there were more follies.Hope this is helpful.

Do not worry about hair loss.\u00a0\u00a0I took 75 mg a day and the loss is minimal, not even noticeable on your head.\u00a0\u00a0Now I am losing no hair at all because I stopped taking DHEA after my transfer last week.\u00a0\u00a0Just like Antitasto said in one of her earlier posts, it is out of your system pretty fast.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I had a bit of acne but nothing the dermatologist could not handle and absolutely no lowering of the voice at all (I think you have to be on a much higher dosage for that to happen.)\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!Angela",

(a bit of an exageration but I got my point across, sure the range may be 35 to 430 but mine measured 46 - so maybe the 80 year old comment wasn't that far off!).\u00a0\u00a0Regardless, the OB won't retest.\u00a0\u00a0So I'm flying blind with what the supplementing has done to my levels.Oh, and... AF hasn't shown up yet which only starts messing with my head (already 3 days later than I would expect it).\u00a0\u00a0I had the most vivid dream last night about having twins after not knowing I was pregnant for 9 months (all came from a news story earlier in the day about women that don't know they're pg until they deliver, unlike me though they are usually very over weight women...anyways, it's amazing what you take into your dreams! lol!).\u00a0\u00a0Oh and yes, I get inside my own head wondering if... but I know the likelihood is next to zero since both tubes are blocked... but how it's messing with me.\u00a0\u00a0Anyhow, all that is why I've stayed of the boards for a few days... trying to find some sanity (and not succeeding!)\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for 'listening' to my rant!Otherwise I'm sticking with the regime of 75mg in the AM plus 25mg in the PM plus my baby aspirin... I'm on day 68 (9.7 weeks) of DHEA... for me that's 3 cycles - which I'm assuming is what the experts / studies seek for optimal DHEA levels in the body - they say 3-4 months but I'm assuming it's cycles of follie / egg growth, so given that I'm getting close to that \"optimal\" time... I sure hope this next cycle is \"THE ONE\"!",

You said there were 4 eggs right?We're doing a transfer of 4 embryos to my surrogate tomorrow....these embryos were my first embies on DHEA. I was so disappointed last time that its hard to think about it.Garden - so sorry to hear about your ob. How about your regular physician? I don't know wat the rules are over there but can you go to another ob or physician? If its absolutely not possible another way to play this game is to have an antral follie count scan on CD21 and CD28. I started this after a couple months and when I finally got to the right DHEA dosage (it was like 150mg/day for me) we could definitely see more follies each month. On CD21 there would be like 6 total, then on CD 25 there'd be 8 and CD28 we'd see 10. Maybe your doc won't go for all those scans but he should at least go for the CD28 so you can track how many follies. I'd say when you see at least 2 - 3 more than before you'll be in good shape and have good egg quality.Hang in there babe! You know my pg was 3 days late after my last failed attempt and I thought I was going to loose my mind. I just went ahead in for an HCG test and got my sanity back.Maybe all of us on this site will end up with our little bundles and move to a 'new mom' discussion together. ;) With Angela's PG I'm optimistic for all of us.Baby dust!Anitasto",

I have been seeing an acupuncturist 3x/week and have been taking the herbs that she prescribed, this has almost completely controlled it.

So no comparison Inhibin B test for you - sorry.But I did do some digging. You may already know this but...just in case and for others...Inhibin B is secreted by the granulosa cells which are the early cells of a follicle and multiply as it grows. It is very much like measuring FSH...e.g. high FSH then few follies, low Inhibin B then few follies.The good news is that becacuse Inhibin B is secreted by granulosa cells, there's no reason to conclude that a low measurement will result in FEW follies after DHEA ultimately results in MORE GRANULOSA CELLS because it results in more follies.If possible, it would b great if you could get your RE to retest your Inhibin B on Day 3 before your next cycle with your other labs. It should be increased. If your experiment is successful then maybe we dheaers could use inhibin B on day 3 as another marker that the dhea is working.http://www.medvet.umontreal.ca/crra_ang/CAP_inhibine.pdfHope this is helpful my dear.Anitasto",

            "answer": "Dg223,First of all \u2013 great job on keeping up with your blood levels. I know you\u2019re nervous, I was totally nervous too. But before going into detail, just want to start by saying that I think you\u2019re ok and don\u2019t need to change anything right now.That said\u2026.here are my thoughts\u2026An excerpt from Casson\u2019s study \u201cDHEA supplementation enhances serum free IGF-I concentrations by ~150%, probably independently of changes in GH secretion\u201dI looked this up because your IGF-1 is going up and SHBG going down even though slightly there should be a more marked change to the opposite. I looked at my own labs historical spreadsheet of bloodwork and then remembered \u2013 IGF-1 oscillates with your cycle.\u00a0\u00a0My IGF-1 was close to baseline on CD3 but increased about 150% on CD21. Forexample, my first IGF-1 on 11/14 CD3 was 152. On 12/01 CD21 it was 215. Ithen had a cyst and cycle messed up but next compare\u2026cd21 on 12/19 it was 200 and then on cd3 01/02 it was 160. Soooo\u2026I\u2019m not surprised based on that if your IGF-1 didn\u2019t increase. However, it would be nice to see your SHBG go down. This is not so critical, however, as long as your Free Testosterone is going up. SHBG binds up hormones and keeps them from acting on other cells\u2026not so great\u2026but you probably have higher free T so shouldn\u2019t be a big deal.SO \u2013 if possible \u2013 ask your sis to call the lab and add on T free (just fyi always request T free and total) and E2.The reason for E2 in particular is\u2026it may explain why your FSH zoomed so high. It\u2019s kind of like clomid. Clomid works by blocking estrogen receptors in the brain so it shovels out FSH which gives you more follies. With high T, as I\u2019ve said here before, I believe your true baseline E2 goes down. In my case it once went like in the teens and at the same time my FSH shot up to 15. We handled it by putting on Vivelle dot patches/estrogen patches at 15 days into my cycle. This prepped the ovaries by quieting them down before the cycle, and also stabilized my fsh to its tue baseline of about 4.1 when my T was around 100.Just one more thing, if your sis can get the lab to do it, ask for GH and free IGF-1. I\u2019m partially curious but also if the others don\u2019t come back as expected it will be more info.The palpatations are ok, I had them for quite a while at that range when I first started before my body adjusted. Be sure you are taking baby aspirin at least twice a day and drinking PLENTY of fluids to offset the added blood thickening that occurs with dhea and greater red blood cell count.Most important. Relax. Don\u2019t drink alcohol or extra sugary stuff and after you ovulate ask for the Vivelle dot patch\u2026.I wore 2/day as it took that much to keep my hyperactive ovaries quiet. I tried oral estrogen but it didn\u2019t do it.Last but not least \u2013 have your DHEA-s and T drawn again in about a week. If your T goes over 150 then I would step it back. I suspect thought that you should be leveling off at or below 120.Hang in there babe! You\u2019re doing great! :)Anitasto",

Also, I presume you're taking your dhea in the am? Just curious because you info would then support my hypothesis that your body really only uses the am intake/or is most receptive that time of day.YES - when my body got the right dose of DHEA it responded in less than 2 weeks with increased T that then leveled off and stayed there. My T first leveled around 40 then around 100, both were completely dose dependent. So if you've been on it a while you could be leveling off. But again, its important to recheck like within a week. You don't want to cut your dose in half and loose the T you've gained. Another option is to take the 2nd 25mg at night. i believe that's like taking a half dose. You have time to work this out before your cycle and you 'could' just get your T and DHEA-s blood to reduce cost.Another thing I found is that it appeared over time my body had the capacity to lose sensitivity to the DHEA. Another reason I caution about going down in dosage because it could take more to get back where you are. This isn't the case for everyone I'm sure...just something to consider and more reason to see if you're continuing to climb before reducing your dose.SOrry for the long post.

Of those, I think its most important that you're on 75mg to start for 2 weeks, check your Dhea-s and T to e sure its being absorbed, and get it up over 80 and keep it there as early as possible. Your quality won't go backward from here I think while you're on dhea, but because of age its really important for you to make sure its working as expected to avoid any loss of time. DH and I lost 6 months until we knew how to test and be sure it was working. Doh!Good luck!BetsyJI think anything with the letters 'meth' in it will likely give you more energy as meth is a stimulant.\u00a0\u00a0Same thing with anything that has 'phen' in it. I could be wrong about this but I think its the most likely reason you have such quick energy.Fat retains hormones is my understanding which is why I think women who eat dairy with fat are more likely to eat other things with fat and more likely to be fertile mertile. Just a postulation though.Pyar -I know this is late and you've probably already had xfer, but the reality is yes...at this point you're down to quality I believe unless there is any kind of implantation issue. Chups has asked about that so I'll come back to that topic later and share what I understand on inhibins and interleukens.ChupsIts possible that your cycle is getting shorter. I say this because if you say you usually sweat when your period begins and for me and others here DHEA shortened our cycles by up to 6 days...that's one possibility. The other is maybe your PG and your body is reacting. I myself have had night sweats off and on for the past 20 years literally. Alot of times its emotional stress (sweated buckets for months after my brother passed away - that was when it started). There are other issues associated with night sweats including diabetes but that has lots of other symptoms too and I would think would be consistent and increase consistently.Hope this is helpful.Hope02 - I gotta run now but I'm thinking on your info and will come back. Simple thoughts are late ovulator because e-100 is ovarian active and likely a folly and LH=11 is up there too. Did you post your age and other info? The more the better...OK - more later my fellow dheaers. Sorry for the delays everyone. I'm glad there are more coming along and trying dhea. I really think it helps of course.

            "answer": "Hi AnitastoYou are a godsend for helping us all out with your knowledge - honestly you should start charging for your services!!As for more info on me - my life story and stats in a paragraph (or two)Went on the pill at age 15 as was getting a period every 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Went off the pill at age 20.\u00a0\u00a0Within 6 months back to bleeding every two weeks (and not just some light spotting) so went back on the pill - took 7 pill changes before I found one that could stop the period every 2 weeks - Diane 35.\u00a0\u00a0Dr's said that the period every 2 weeks was a great thing - it meant that I was super fertile!!!!\u00a0\u00a0Stayed on the pill until I met my husband - he has a rare skin condition -epidermolysis bullosa - has the dominant condition and is a carrier of the recessive - I havent been tested for the recessive but chances are slim that I would have it - tis a death sentence for our child if I do.\u00a0\u00a0We explored IVF PGD for genetic purposes only as my husband felt strongly about not passing his skin on.\u00a0\u00a0No known fertility issues.\u00a0\u00a0In fact I still thought i was 'super fertile'!!\u00a0\u00a0First IVF cycle in April 08 (I am 32 and my husband 28) - long down reg cycle - FSH doubled after 3 days to 300u as I was not responding - cycled cancelled after 8 days stimming.\u00a0\u00a0Period arrived 6 days later (this didnt surprise me with my history though my FS was surprised) Cycle 2 antagonist started on first day of period - after BT which showed my hormones had baselined.\u00a0\u00a0Cycle 2 cancelled after 4 days due to oestrogen producing cyst.\u00a0\u00a0Trigger injection given and period arrived 10 days later.\u00a0\u00a0Cycle 3 started - antagonist - 300u daily from the start - got to EPU - 8 follies, 6 eggs, - of these: 1 was 'cracked', 2 were immature, 2/3 that fertilised were abnormal despite the ICSI (1 had 3 pronuclei and the other 1).\u00a0\u00a0The final egg got to 5 cells was fragmenting badly and didnt go furhter.\u00a0\u00a0Dr said that things werent looking and that we needed to prepare ourselves for not having our own children - said that to get 3 pronuclei doing ICSI was highly unusual.\u00a0\u00a0She also said though that she wasnt out of ideas and suggested I try DHEA.\u00a0\u00a0I guess the fact that we know that 50% of our embryos will have my husbands condition means that we really need more eggs - or will need to do lots of cycles - we are prepared for this, now.\u00a0\u00a0We then almost immediately started cycle 4 - my FS said that we could take a break but she thought that the FSH in my system from the last few cycles could also help with quality - I also immediately started taking DHEA 75mg (even though Dr only prescribed 50mg a day - I had found this post within days of starting the dhea)\u00a0\u00a0I have been having 50mg in the morning and 25mg at night - not sure if I should change this to all inthe morning??\u00a0\u00a0Cycle 4 - long down reg - started on 400u daily FSH.\u00a0\u00a0Again had 8 follies - 4 eggs at EPU - all 4 fertilised normally, 2 made it to the necessary blastocyst stage by day 6 for biopsy and were good enough quality for biopsy (though were rated fair not good) - 1 was unaffected and transferred - BFN.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped taking the DHEA on the day of EPU under my Dr's advice but recommenced as soon as I got the BFN - was only off it for about 2 weeks in total.\u00a0\u00a0EPU for this cycle was on July 4 - I am now getting ready for cycle 5 - and was going to start the lucrin on Monday - however my BT results came back at E - 100, LH - 11, and P - 0 :\u00a0\u00a0which my Dr says is baseline.\u00a0\u00a0Hence as of yesterday I am now back on the pill and still taking the DHEA.\u00a0\u00a0I dont know what it means at all that I have been on DHEA for a couple of months now with only a short break and my hormones are so low on day 19 of a natural cycle???Anyways - wow what\u00a0\u00a0a post - I think that is pretty much all the info that i can give you (other than that my husbands swimmers have been tested and are all really good - so any issues it would seem are with me) - any thoughts you have or possible solutions would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again for your help.\u00a0\u00a0HOpe",

            "answer": "All of the information posted is very helpful. Even though a lot of the abbreviations don't mean a lot to me. Let me tell you my story...I am 42 years old and am considered obese. I finally married for the first time at the ripe old age of 39. My husband had been married previously, but had never had any children. Before marriage I had resigned that I would be a single, childless spinster. After marriage, we could think of nothing else.We went to the doctor, and were given the odds (due to my weight). My husband was tested and given thumbs up on count and motility (and something else, but I have forgotten now). However it was discovered that I do not ovulate every month.My doctor prescribed Clomid. which we took for over a year and nothing happened. Then in August of last year, my doctor was on vacation and the on-call-doctor refused to refill my prescription (said she found no evidence of it, which really made my doctor mad when she returned). When it came time for my cycle to start in Sept, I didn't. I was pregnant. Unfortunately, it didn't last for very long. I miscarried 2 days before our 2nd anniversary (great gift, huh?)We were devastated and heart-broken. But my doctor assured me that we did this on our own, and that means we could do it again.Well, it's been almost a year since the miscarriage, and nothing. I was afraid to go back on the Clomid because I had heard that it could cause cancer. But my doctor tells me that there is no evidence supporting that. I start taking Clomid again this Sunday, and have started taking DHEA today (after reading everything I can possibly find on the subject)I have not told my doctor about the DHEA, but I have an appointment to see her on the 18th and will discuss it with her then. I am a little afraid of what she might say, but I really can't waste anymore time. At the rate things are going, I will 50 before I get pregnant! But I have faith in God and medicine! In the meantime I will continue to read this thread. It is very inspiring.Keep your fingers crossed that we can do this!prg5266",

            "answer": "Hope02,Thanks for posting your story. It sounds like you\u2019ve really been through the ringer. It does sound though like the DHEA made a difference in your last cycle. And its so great that your RE recommened it for you. Whatever the issue with your current levels whether annovulation or lack of progesterone production, it appears your IVF is overcoming these so I hope you can take comfort in that. Below are comments and questions for you to see if we can draw some conclusions together.\u201cI dont know what it means at all that I have been on DHEA for a couple of months now with only a short break and my hormones are so low on day 19 of a natural cycle??? \u201cYour E2 seems fine for a single follicle. Your P=0 just means you didn\u2019t ovulate\u2026.as I\u2019m sure you understand. This can happen on DHEA too, especially if you had a tendency to be annovulatory prior to DHEA. I believe this happened to me in 2 cycles on DHEA. Your LH level just means you haven\u2019t yet or aren\u2019t going to ovulate. Again, not so surprising if you didn\u2019t ovulate before DHEA. Why are your cycles 2 weeks? Typically it\u2019s a luteal phase defect and either your ovulating but producing no progesterone or not ovulating at all.If you weren\u2019t ovulating before or have a luteal phase defect then DHEA will not \u2018necessarily\u2019 always repair this, but IVF can overcome it. It would be good to confirm this either way though.Here are some questions for you..1. What were your baselines in the past on day 3ish for FSH and E2?2. Have you ever done a home LH test to verify ovulation? If you don\u2019t ovulate, then of course you wouldn\u2019t have Progesterone. But its possible to ovulate and have little to none. LH is also valuable for egg quality and\u2026given your quality\u2026.I\u2019m curious. These are cheap at Walmart \u2026\u2026 if you haven\u2019t tried this before\u2026if you start testing now we could see if you get to ovulation before your flow.3. Was your progesterone ever tested at any time during your short cycles prior to ivf? A lot of women are short on progesterone and have shorter cycles and its easily solved with supplements. I\u2019m sure you probably know this stuff but just wanted to cover the bases.4. Have you had any BW on DHEA, DHEA-s and Testosterone (T)? This will also be helpful. I\u2019m guessing these are low for your age because of quality and you\u2019re still getting 8 eggs as a reflection of your age\u2026.so its not terribly low like us old timers here. ;)5. Do you workout a lot\u2026how much?6. Do you drink\u2026.how much?7. Are you particularly lean?I don\u2019t know but, like dg223, you\u2019ve peaked my interest and I\u2019ll stay with you in trying to solve the puzzle if you feel determined.I\u2019d love to get paid for this\u2026.if you or anyone you know has a link to a publisher please feel free to put us in touch. I\u2019ve drafted 6 chapters so far. ;)Look forward to your info.Best,Anitasto",

            "answer": "Couple of info bytes on follicle growth to help understand why DHEA and T help us out\u2026.Follicles are predominantly composed of Testosterone until they are about 7-8mm after which they convert to Estrogen dominance. (This is why I think baseline follie scan should show all follies at or below 7mm instead of 10mm\u202610 is not optimal and those follies have already begun synthesizing FSH and will horde it from the others generally speaking. This is especially true if you tend to have lead follicle(s)). The follicular fluid, in addition to T, also has DHEA and other goodies. The only T that can go into these guys is Free Testosterone since the rest is bound to Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG). If you exercise A LOT, your T can be lowered by synthesis to proteins to build or repair muscles (anyone please correct me on this if I\u2019ve stated it wrong or not fully enough). I tested it also after workout and then when I wasn\u2019t working out. My Sunday 20 mile bike race dropped it in half two times in a row. So I quit that\u2026.though probably should have still done like 5 miles for circulation\u2026.and it climbed and maintained at over 80 pg/ml. I tested the effect of alcohol also and it dropped my T by 2/3 after like 5 shots of rum. There\u2019s not a lot of literature on this but there was some.",
