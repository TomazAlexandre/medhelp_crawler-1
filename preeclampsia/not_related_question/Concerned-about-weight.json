Most of it was water weight since i had preeclampsia but i felt huge and gross. Very alone too because none of my friends ever gained that much during there pregnancies. Im 8weeks now with my second child and i have already gained 10lbs. The docs got mad at me for gaining so much already and i feel like ill be a whale again with this one too. Ugh :( i just don't understand why i always gain so much.",

    "question": "I notice that everyone else is a lot smaller, and skinnier than I am. I am just concerned because I weighted 138lbs when I was 6 weeks. I am now 9 weeks, and I have my doctors appointment next monday, and im just worried I am going to be over weight my whole pregnancy. But what *****, is before I met my husband I only weight barely 100lbs, and now I just feel so fat, I already have ugly pink stetch marks everywhere. I feel so ugly. Can anyone else relate or am I just crazy?:(",
