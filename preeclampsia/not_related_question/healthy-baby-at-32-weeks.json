    "question": "What are the chances of having a healthy baby at 32 weeks? I don't want my baby to come out now, but he's acting like he is ready and its stressing me out...but im just trying to relax in knowing that he would be ok if he decided to come now. Does anyone have any experiance in babies being born this early? Again, i want to make it known that i have done nothing to bring this on, not even walking a lot since my feet have been so swollen, and i WANT him to stay in as long as possible so please no lectures.",
