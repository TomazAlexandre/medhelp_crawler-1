            "answer": "Your not alone. I am having the same thing happen to me. Please let me know what you find out I am having a similar problem exepet i have not been told i have Endomertiosos and Adenomyosis.3 years ago i started getting 2 periods a month. Nobody could figure out why. Hormonoal imbalance was occuring. I wanted to find out what was causing this and solve the problem not cover up the symptoms by taking birth control pills to get regulated or fertility drugs to have kids. I know i was exposed to some chemicals in my environmental consulting career that could be causing an imbalance.I started taking herbal supplements and changed my diet to eating all organic meats and vegetables and cut out eating beef altogether. My periods are back to normal since i have done this.But now i am bleeding during and the day after i have sex, and also when i make a bowel movement from the vagina. Just went to obgyn and said my cervics is \"friable\" in nature and bleeds to the touch.She said it could be a number of things like bacteria infection, STD or PID or cervical cancer, or partner could be just hitting my cervics.She said that the blood when i do NO2 might be coming from by anus and to make sure by putting toliet paper inside after making a bowel movement and get back to her when it happens. It is not coming from the anus.My boyfriend thinks i should stop looking things up on the internet because it is just getting me more worried and wait to find out from the doctor.",

            "answer": "Great Questions!\u00a0\u00a0 I have had vaginal bleeding during bowel movement too.\u00a0\u00a0It occurs only once per month but very predictably a couple days before my period.\u00a0\u00a0This has\u00a0\u00a0been going on for several years. ( as backgound, I am 40, two kids, never had endometriosis and do not have it now.\u00a0\u00a0Get regular colonoscopy and exams, thin prep and PAPs always negative, 28 day cycle)Ugly details:\u00a0\u00a0After BM, bright red blood in commode and on toilet tissue.\u00a0\u00a0(positive that it is vaginal, not rectal) the curious thing is that once it happens there is no residual bleeding at all.\u00a0\u00a0No further spotting on the same day, no darker blood, nothing.\u00a0\u00a0Happens once per cycle and that is it until next month.Diagnoses:\u00a0\u00a0Had Uterine Hystosonogram done (ultrsound with water) to better see if any polyps present.\u00a0\u00a0Found at least two tiny polyps in uterus. They were clearly visable even to my untrained eye. Scheduled day surgery to have them removed and to biopsy tissues just in case.Once doctor went in, could not find the polyps.\u00a0\u00a0She took tissue samples for biopsy.Biopsy came back all clear for cancer, but pathology showed that I have a 'disorganized endometrium'.\u00a0\u00a0This was explained as follows:\u00a0\u00a0When looking at the cells of uterine lining, they should all present at pretty much the same stage of your cycle.\u00a0\u00a0IE: if you are on the 10th day of your menstrual cycle,\u00a0\u00a0all of the lining cells should look about 10 days old (for simplicity sake).\u00a0\u00a0My cells were 'disorganized' with some presenting at 5 days, some at 15, some at 21 etc.This might explain the cause of the off cycle bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor put me on birth control pills for 3 months and then wants to do another biopsy in November.\u00a0\u00a0She said the BC pills should kick my lining back onto the right schedule.I am skeptical.\u00a0\u00a0If this were the cause of the bleeding, then logically, I should be experiencing inconsistant spotting at least a couple times per month, rather than the very consistant 'two days before' situation I explained earlier.I started on the BC pills in July.\u00a0\u00a0When I was close to the date that my period should start on the pill, I had the exact same bleeding two days before onset.I am now into the second month...we will see what happens next.I am interested in anyone else's experience and outcome which was diagnosed similarly or due to non-endormetriosis reasons.",

Other tests (two colposcopies, pelvic ultrasound, transvaginal ultrasound, cervical biopsy, and endometrial biopsy) have all been normal.My general practitioner and OBGYN have noted a cervical ectropion...tissue changes on my cervix, probably brought on by birth control, are highly vascularized and bleed at the slightest touch.

After an examination, she referred me to a Women's hospital here in Vancouver to see if I was a candidate for cryo-surgery. After an exam with a camera the doctor determined that it was not my uterus bleeding, but my cervix was VERY sensitive and would bleed to the touch, and like many of you here during bowel movements, sex, even sitting too long. He mentioned that this cryo-surgery (freezing of the spot that is bleeding on the cervix) may only have an 85% success rate but assured me that I was a good candidate and it leaves very little scar tissue. We went ahead with the procedure right there in the exam room, it took about 10 minutes. It has been over 4 weeks, and since the healing process has been over I have had a NO problems, and NO MORE BLEEDING! I am so relieved, I have not seen a spot of blood since the surgery and I am able to continue my life as normal!!!

            "answer": "I have been having the exact same 'symptoms' of vaginal bleeding after bowel movements.Background: I have been on birth control pills since age 21. Switched to Evra (patch) at age 28. At age 30, started spotting mid-cycle and on strained bowel movement. This coincided with my moving to Canada and I thought that the patch in Canada might be a different type/ dose, hence causing the mid-cycle bleeding. Family doctor checked my pap results, said there are no problems and to live with it, since it's just an 'annoyance.' Went to another family doctor a few months later, who suggested I go off Evra and back on to a 'lighter dose' pill. This didn't help, but then I stopped taking the pill altogether (Jan 2008) in order to try to conceive. Took me 6 months.I am now 31 and 16.5 weeks pregnant. Early in the first trimester I had some light bleeding on and off. Had a pap smear at 8 weeks pregnant, and when the doctor removed the speculum, I bled a LOT, which totally freaked me out. Doctor said he could see blood pooling in my cervix. I had an ultrasound and the baby is fine.I had no further bleeding until 15 weeks, when the bleeding on bowel movement started again. It is bright red and I can feel it dripping in the toilet. I've now also started bleeding after sex. I have read this is due to a softened cervix during pregnancy. Whatever the reason, it's pretty scary especially when pregnant!My prenatal care has been transferred to an OB-GYN and had my first appointment today. Seems my pregnancy multivitamin is making me somewhat constipated, so my OB is switching me to another. She did not seem concerned otherwise about the bleeding, so we'll see what happens.",

However, due to my pregnant state he cannot do anything further or take a cervical biopsy, so I am scheduled to see him 4 weeks after delivery.

            "answer": "My gosh, I can so relate to most of the comments. I too have been in this boat of wonderment and inconclusive testing. I am 33 years old and have had two children and in July of 2007 I began having pain in my groin area. In October I was referred to a general surgeon who thought I probably had two small hernia's and would have to deal with the pain until they were big enough to repair...flash forward to July 2008 and alot of pain later. I had an exploratory Laprascopy and my OB/GYN found some endometriosis. My pain and issues since then have really been tough. I found out I was pregnant less than a month after my surgery in July of 2008 and my vaginal drainage and bleeding ceased for about 2 months during my pregnancy...but something still didn't feel right. We found out on Halloween of 08 that we had lost the baby. I was 12 weeks pregnant but the babys' heart had stopped at 10 weeks as well as it's growth. I opted to have a procedure the very next day to remove the baby and pregnancy. I proceeded to have continued bleeding/clotting/pain...my doctor kept reassuring me that it was normal and he had removed everything, even after me explaining that there was still tissue coming out. I finally convinced him to check my hormone level, which was still elevated. After a few more weeks of the same symptoms, he convinced me to come into the office and he would easily suck the rest of the pregnancy out, and that I could tough out the pain and it would be over in a few seconds. When I got to the office he ultrasounded and found the remaining tissue and when he tried to \"easily\" suck it out, it would not budge. The suction procedure turned into a D and C, which is an actually scraping of my uterus. This being the same procedure I had originally had under general anesthesia. This was painful. Even after that 3rd procedure it still took my body time time complete the loss. Overall, it was about 1 1/2 months of agony. With the dr trying to convince me that everything was ok and that I needed to just try to forget about it. Now my current symptoms are browninsh to bloody to light tissue type drainage, this happens everytime I sit on the toilet whether I am peeing or having a bowel movement. I do bleed heavy with intercourse as well and it last for days at a time. As you can imagine alot of days go by that I am not wanting my husband to touch me or think about having sex with me. I feel so guilty because I know how much he loves me and how much he wants to. At this point, he has told me to just let him know when I am ready. I have been back to the dr and his nurse midwife. They have said that I have a \"friable\" cervix and it's all normal. But have no ideas to help my situation. I am really insecure about the drainage and have to wear at least a panty liner on a daily basis. This has definitely gotten worse, yet they say it's normal. I feel like I am going crazy. My dr. made a comment to me, \"it's not like you have cancer or something\". I really don't feel heard but I don't feel too encouraged that any other dr would be able to help me either. I don't know where to go from here. We do plan on trying to get pregnant again but not until May or later. But that's kind of difficult when you aren't really having much of a sex life either. Awe, the difficulties of woman hood.",

No doctor can pin point any particular cause and it seems to me that with so many women with the same problem, more doctors would be exploring the issues and getting answers instead of putting it off on us as just being a woman. If that were the case, all women would be suffering from it and one time or another. Most women I know dont have these symtoms and never had. I am now 30, had HPV when I was 20. I had cryo surgery to remove 2 small growths on my cervix soon after the HPV was found. I had 3 children within 7 years after that all happened. I did not experience any bleeding during intercourse or bowel movements until after my 3rd child was born. All paps have been normal since and I have not been on any BC since my 3rd child was born.

I had what I was told was a lesion of blood vessels on my cervix which made them very sensitive to the touch. I was scheduled to have a hysterectomy on Dec. 2, which my insurance denied. I had to go through cryo-therapy and that didn't work. On Febuary 19 my Dr. scheduled a leep procedure (keep in my mind my 2nd Dr.) He wanted to perform it in the hospital because the bleeding had become so bad. When I woke up it was to the dreadful words of my Dr. telling me I had cervical cancer. When all of this began in Sept. \"07\" I had papsmear, ultrasound, endometrial biopsy. I was told that it was a hormonal problem and given a merina iud. The bleeding continued (keep in mind all of the test above came back good.)I was told that my body would take time to adjust to the iud. I wasted 11 precious monthes with this moron of a Dr. I thank God everyday that I finally went for that 2nd opinion. My 2nd. Dr. done all of the same test and all came back good once again. I guess I just want to warn everyone that papsmears are not always correct and you know when theres something wrong with your body so be persistent don't take the word of just 1 Dr. get a 2nd and a 3rd. if thats what it takes. I was reffered to a wonderful GYN Oncologist, who staged my cancer at 1B1. On March 12th. I had a radical hysterectomy. I'm happy to say that all lymphnodes were clear and my Dr. thinks I will be fine and I don't have to have any further treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Ladies PLEASE don't take this matter lightly..",

I had a 70% chance of never having period again. Of course that was not the case. I am in the 30% that start having problems again. I have since started seeing a new OBGYN.

            "answer": "The last time I posted was January 25th. Alot has happened since then...I was referred to an M.D., by a close friend, who specialized in \"holistic care\" or \"naturopathy type care. Before my first visit he had me fill out a 13 page questionaire and during my\u00a0\u00a01 1/2 hour, first visit, with him, he highlighted all the concerns he had with my symptoms and then proceeded to ask\u00a0\u00a0me more about them. He didn't make me feel rushed and he seemed to enjoy the investigation part of the appointment. By the end of the appointment, he had about three different ideas and he then ordered about 15 different lab tests to verify what he thought could be wrong. The most different part of the appointment was at the end he said to me, \"I will be able to help you with these problems\". I had to question what he said, and he again assured me, \"yes, I will be able to help you\". I wanted to cry. I told him no one else had told me that in the past 1 1/2 years. It was more of \" well sorry you are having these things happen in your life/body, but there isn't anything we can do\". This really gave me newfound hope, strength and reinforcement that what was going on wasn't right and that someone else could actually help my symptoms. Some of the most significant lab tests results were my estrogen, progesterone and growth hormone levels. To remind you I was on birth control pills from age 18 to age 27. At that point I got pregnant and proceeded to either be pregnant or be breastfeeding for the next 4-5 years, including my miscarriage pregnancy. I didn't use any birth control pills during these years. In July of 2008, I had surgery for endometriosis. And then immediately got pregnant within that next month. I had my miscarriage in November. And then had two D/C's due to retained tissue. I had irregular bleeding as well as many other symptoms like pms-type symptoms, always feeling cold, exhaustion, mild depression, loss of appetite, nausea, irregular bowel movements, headaches, frequent illness to name a few. In December, I decided to go back on birthcontrol pills. My nurse midwife thought it would help my symptoms and I for sure didn't want to get pregnant at that point. So I was on Yaz up until this month. Typically, when you are on birth control pills it does decrease your own hormones like progesterone, estrogen, and growth hormone. A typical estrogen level while on birth control pills would be a minimum of 100 but optimal would be 200 level....mine was only 20. This blood test was done on day 20 of my cycle. My doctor told me that this would be a typical level of a man!! My progesterone and growth hormone were also much lower than they should have been.He suggested I stop my birth control pills at the end of this cycle. He also found that my serum iron level was extremely low as well as my vitamin D level and a thyroid level was off as well. My thyroid level has been checked before and it was always within normal limits but he took it a step farther and did many other thyroid checks along with my temperatures that he had me take during my period, this showed there is some insufficiency with my thyroid. Not enough to put me on Synthroid or the like but enough that it could be effecting my cycle and bleeding. So I am now taking many supplements here are a few....prometrium(progesterone), vitamin D, Iron, Zinc, prenatal vitamin, Iodine(for the thyroid issue), DHEA. Then once I finish this packet of Yaz I will stop taking them and start taking an estrogen gel from day 4-28. This is a gel that I will rub into my thigh. This will allow my own natural hormones to start building again and with the combination of the other supplements start regulating my entire system. I have also been checked for food allergies in the past and found to be sensitive to yeast both bakers and brewers. That alone can cause many multi system issues. So he has me on difulucan for 10 days to help kill any extra yeast in my body.He said it will take a few cycles to get me regulated and from that point on we will determine how healthy I feel to try to get pregnant again. I urge all of you to search for a M.D that will really \"hear\" what your concerns and symptoms are. It's amazing to actually have an appointment with an M.D. who is familiar with all of these things and is confident in being able to make a change for the better in your life. I have found since I have been taking the prometrium(progesterone) that I don't have the irregular bleeding, like during bowel movements and sex etc...I can only imagine what changes will take place once I get my estrogen level to a healthy number. I would like to mention my OB/Gyn never once checked my estrogen/progesterone level while I was under his care. Good luck to you all and I will keep you updated through this process.",

They are formed after you ovulate and the corpus luteum folds back on itself and traps blood which may continue to accumulate and can burst on its' own or during a bowel movement when there's more pressure in the pelvis.\u00a0\u00a0The ultrasound also showed I have a subseptate uterus and we're being referred to a fertility specialist but our appt is not until June.\u00a0\u00a0I have been having brown spotting usually the last 10 days or so before my period since I went off the Pill in September.\u00a0\u00a0This was so different looking than that though.\u00a0\u00a0Today, same thing happened again and I'm 10 days past the positive ovulation predictor kit, so I can only assume it's another cyst that just burst.\u00a0\u00a0I just have some light brown spotting now, no blood.\u00a0\u00a0Sigh. This is so frustrating but when I checked out some other internet sites about the hemorrhagic cysts, it does indeed say that it can happen over and over.\u00a0\u00a0Grrrr.\u00a0\u00a0I had no problems of any sort prior to going off the Pill.\u00a0\u00a0This all started when I went off.\u00a0\u00a0I am so anxious to conceive and we are so excited to have a baby so this is pretty scary, but I'm hoping it's \"just the hemmorhagic cysts\" and am very interested in what the fertility doc says when we see him in June.\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there, everyone.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe we are all okay after all?",

We had a bit of a 'scare' in that I had some bleeding 1 week before baby's due date and I passed a *huge* blood clot, but everything was fine except that I had started dilating. Baby went on to be born exactly on her due date.I saw the colposcopy specialist twice (3 weeks and 3 months after birth) and everything still checks out okay. He did one more pap smear and he's handed over care back to my family doctor, as all changes he's seen are expected though accelerated and tests come back normal.I've not had bleeding since the birth (and have yet to get my period since I'm breastfeeding). So for me, things are looking good.",

I have lower back pain which i know is due to Endo..bad cramp uhhh I feel for each one of you and I hope something is done for your comfort..!But one thing that recently happend to me is.. I had a new partner a few months ago where there was one time we didnt use protection and I got Chlamydia from.. well I went to the hospital becuase it made my condition so worse I felt like I was in labor with really bad low back pain and stomach cramps.. thought I was passing something.. That was the first time that i got a pap dont and it didnt hurt or feel weird but i bleed right after i had pap done which isnt normal for me.. Its scary the things that are out there .. so from one women to another please be safe..",

I've just started getting testing done, so far tons of blood work and an ultrasound is scheduled.. I only feel mild cramping, but it's all the time.. I don't have any Endomertiosis or any other issues like that (that I know of) I have quite a bit of back pain.. I have 3 children and I'm 30 years old, there was never any problems during or after pregnancy with any of them. I haven't had my period since the everyday spotting has started yet (due soon) but the one before this was light except one day of really intense heavy painful bleeding, lots of clots and filled pads by the hour.. Good news is, my doctor is very concerned and is sending me for every test she can think of and won't stop until we have answers.. so I will add an update here if we find anything that might help any of you.",

            "answer": "Hi like most of you I'm experiencing the same problems. I'm 23/f. I first started having bleeding with bowels back when I was 19 or 20. Went to the doc never found anything. So I started the nuva ring as a new contraceptive and had been on it until oct 09. About a year ago I noticed some spotting after intercourse but didn't really think it was a concern. I figured that my nuva ring may have just rubbed wrong and caused a little blood. Now within the last 3 mo since I took the ring out I have had more bleeding. Now I am either bleeding during intercourse or right after, and sometimes it will not come for a few hours after. Either way I bleed and its visible on toilet paper and my undergarment. I have been checked Pap's are clear, no std's, ultrasound, and colposcopy and biopsy. They didn't find anything. I was then referred to a OBGYN and he said its just some spotting on my cervix similar to cervicitis(causes abnormal bleeding). The only ways to get rid of this spot is by freezing or laser removal. My OBGYN explained he doesn't believe in that because if for some reason I ever had more issues the procedure would remove the spot they had been \"concerned\" with. I agree with him on that part, but I don't agree with him when he told me to just put the BC back in and see what happens. I am willing to try for a period of time, but with how much blood i've had with intercourse its very scary. One reason is because I've never had children and also because my Aunt(mother's sister) had vaginal cancer at 25. Within the last few days I have had bowel movements with bleeding from the vaginal area. I too have the chronic fatigue and back pains. The last symptom is I notice when I am pushing for the BM it hurts in my ovary area.I am planning on getting a second opinion, but am very scared. I'm glad im not alone in this.",

Went to doc last week for internal ultrasound. Have a uterine polyp and 2 very small cysts on on ovary. I also get sharp pains in my abdomen. Would the pain be from the cysts or the polyp? Doc said cysts very very tiny. This time I had very bad back pain also. Go to specialist in April for treatment options. Anyone else have any hormonal history earlier before these problems happened?

The only thing is that I never did have heavy periods - even approaching the menopause.

He said that I have cervical ectropion (google it to find more info), which he could see during the colp. exam that he did. It's apparently a harmless condition that is associated with being on the pill-- I'm not on the pill but was for 10 years. It occurs when endometiral cells are present on the cervix, and he said it just happens sometimes. He said he can remove the cells (by freezing) if it's very bothersome, but would prefer to do nothing.I can't even begin to say what a relief it is to find out what's wrong. For years I've been worried everytime some bleeding occurs. I hope this helps someone else!!",

I don't expect an answer, but if I hear one I will certainly post again!\"To Whom It May Concern atThe American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecologistsand The American Gynecological and Obstetrical Society,Thank you so much for taking the time to read this letter and for providing any assistance or information you may have to offer!\u00a0\u00a0I will be as brief as I can be.In seeking answers to my own persistent symptoms of unusual vaginal bleeding over the last few years (with three different doctors) and finding no explanations, I turned, as many women do, to online sources for OB/GYN information.\u00a0\u00a0In doing so, I discovered hundreds of women - of all ages and stages, with or without children - talking about exactly the same symptoms of a particular kind of vaginal bleeding and how they have all been \"living with it\" without accurate diagnoses for years.\u00a0\u00a0I know that the internet is not necessarily a reliable source; however, I was mainly struck by how many of us describe the exact same experience - and the exact same frustration at finding no clear answers or solutions from our doctors. They seem to be STUMPED!\u00a0\u00a0(Here is one example of such a discussion:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Womens-Health/Vaginal-bleeding-after-during-sex-and-with-a-bowel-movement/show/31554)\u00a0\u00a0So I am reaching out to you, as leaders in the OB/GYN profession, to seek guidance and some insight into the medical discussion of this topic.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure for every woman who has shared their symptoms with their doctors or online, there are many others who have not.Most commonly, this vaginal bleeding occurs at the same time in our cycles - after ovulation, during the luteal phase (beginning a few days up to 2 weeks prior to menstration and continuing until menstrual bleeding) - and can be seen during bowel movements or after/during sex.\u00a0\u00a0The bleeding is most certainly vaginal, either bright bright red and dripping into the toilet or old and brown when we wipe.\u00a0\u00a0For most of us, we have regular menstration and this is distinct from that.\u00a0\u00a0Some have experienced pain along with this bleeding, but not all.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to these shared symptoms, we all have one other important thing in common; our doctors have tried out many possibilities and found \"NOTHING WRONG.\"\u00a0\u00a0Almost all of us have been to multiple GP's and OB/GYN's (in addition to GE's) and have had a whole range diagnostic procedures, thankfully ruling out cervical and uterine cancers, polyps, fibroid tumors, endomedriosis (some have it; most do not), vagicitis, and everything else under the sun.\u00a0\u00a0Some of us have been told we might have things like \"disorganized endometrium\", \"friable cervix\", \"Tilted Uterus\", \"Hemorrhagic Cysts\" -\u00a0\u00a0with procedures suggested that are more frightening than the original symptoms. Often these procedures - including hysterectomy - fail to stop the bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0ALL of us have been on Oral Contraceptives (pill, nuvaring, IUD, etc.) and the onset of these symptoms begin to occur while taking them or after we stop.\u00a0\u00a0Some women have even being prescribed them to help with these symptoms, with no result.\u00a0\u00a0A few women seem to have had some success monitoring their hormone levels and increasing their body's natural production of progesterone (through natural creams, synthetic depositories, herbal medicines, and acupuncture) - learning from some wisdom in fertility treatments.\u00a0\u00a0But many others have said that their doctors have refused to test their hormone levels. (For instance, my doctor did everything she could think of and then told me it was probably \"hormonal\" and, basically, to live with it (though my uterus is a little tilted.)\u00a0\u00a0Others had doctors who were flat out dismissive, never heard of anything like it, or thought they were inventing it.))\u00a0\u00a0Some have begun to try food allergies and to change their diets.\u00a0\u00a0Results of all of this pending.Obviously, such cyclical and frequent vaginal bleeding interferes with our daily functioning, sexual and relationship health, and stress levels.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, we have many fears about - and many different success rates of - healthy conception and delivery.\u00a0\u00a0Most importantly, all the women sharing their stories have also expressed extreme disappointment and frustration in the lack of expertise and knowledge about the topic by medical professionals, even when their symptoms have persisted for many years (in some cases decades).\u00a0\u00a0It is possible that many OB/GYNs have seen these cases more than others, but this expertise does not seem to be widely shared.\u00a0\u00a0I understand that every woman's body is different, that we all have different experiences/biologies/genetics/personal histories, and that there may be many factors.\u00a0\u00a0However, it is surprising that our stories are all the same, and we are still left with so many questions.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps there is something broader going on - something environmental, dietary, or a shared side effect?\u00a0\u00a0At the very least, if we had the information, we could made more responsible decisions.Can you tell me/us:\u00a0\u00a0Is this topic being raised in discussion between OB/GYN doctors?\u00a0\u00a0Is there any current research on these symptoms and possible causes?\u00a0\u00a0Is anyone sounding any alarms about birth control, environmental toxins, food industry changes, or other hard-to-pinpoint possible causes of unusual vaginal bleeding late in the menstrual cycle?\u00a0\u00a0(Is anyone presenting anything on the topic at your upcoming Conference in Chicago?)\u00a0\u00a0If so, I hope that doctors will begin to share their knowledge and disseminate information more widely, so that the women going through this can feel more understood, listened to, cared for, taken seriously, and brought back to normal reproductive and sexual health - the main goals of your practices.Thank you so much for reading, and I hope to hear from you soon!\"---",

            "answer": "There is another post that I have responded to regarding friable cervix onhttp://www.medhelp.org. It's a lot of people with similar symptoms as described in this post. I too have this condition \"friable cervix\". My OBGYN didn't seem too concerned & didn't recommend treatment. She did say she could do something to the cervix to try to make it less friable but I decided not to bother because every person I've heard of having it done, has had a reccurance of symptoms shortly after the procedure. I have never had HPV (seems common) and I've never had any children. I am currently 32 and this began when I was about 28. I do however have IBD and I wonder if inflammation has something to do with my cervix being friable. I do believe many of my issues are hormonal in nature and possibly have something to do with birth control pills. I have been on hormonal birth control for about 10 years. I recently switched to a non-estrogen pill called cerazette and it has helped a bit. I wouldn't say I am cured, I still have strange bleeding but I only seem to have it around my period - I can deal with that. I think I will see somoene about my hormones. Something is out of whack. I am sure I won't find any answers, if I do, I will report back.I find it very frustrating that so many of us are dealing with bleeding after sex & BM and we can't find any answers.",

I have a retroverted uterus and a cervix that is in a direct 'firing line' position.\u00a0\u00a0I have periods for 10+days that include days of bright red bleeding similar to a nosebleed, and days of regular menstruation with an incredible number and size of clots.\u00a0\u00a0These clots are so large they escape my super heavy duty industrial size pads and end up in the floor at work, at the grocery, at a restaurant, and is humiliating.\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested for everything to no avail.\u00a0\u00a0All I've ever been diagnosed with is an abnormally thickened lining of the uterus.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have fibroids or polyps that were found during D&C, but I do have colon polyps that were removed and a strong family history of colon cancer.\u00a0\u00a0However, the blood is not coming from my colon.\u00a0\u00a0I was negative for Endometriosis.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor had the same reaction to bleeding during a BM as everyone else's.\u00a0\u00a0I have just this week cancelled my hysterectomy because I'm just not ready to get old yet and I fear gaining weight.

I usually bleed between 10 and 7 days before my period, when I have a bowel movement or I push down, and when I have sex. It's usually fresh blood.I have had a history of non successful use of birth control pills, and by non successful I mean that every 3-8 month I would have to change it because I would have bloody discharge in the middle of the month. The last birth control I used was the ring, which worked for 6-8 months.I mentioned to my former doctor a year ago that I was having bloody discharge and bleeding after intercourse, she said it was not normal but\u00a0\u00a0that \"maybe he was too big for me\".... I am not sure how my husband and sexual couple for 4 years can suddenly grow and hurt me that much :S.Around the same time, the ring \"stopped\" working, and at that moment we were thinking of having a family, so I stopped taking any birth control.By September 2011, the bleeding was more often and more quantity, for which I went to the doctor again, and she said that I had \" CERVICAL ECTROPION\" and I had to \"learn how to live with it\".I sought another opinion and my current doctor said it is called with different names, but that I have EVERSION which are cells from the cervix that come out and react to the hormones, that's why I bled mostly in the second part of the cycle. He also mentioned, he would never put me in the ring. He has also mentioned that I probably developed like this, and he does not know why this started beeing such a problem now....Currently, I have had two sessions of silver nitrate treatment in order to \"cauterize\" the cells that are bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0I am also doing some acupuncture, in order to attack the problem on all areas! Hopefully they will work! I will keep you guys posted on the results....As far as conceiving, I haven't been able to, obviously, because the blood is changing the pH of the vagina and probably all the spermatozoides are being killed.... :(I would encourage you all to at least to get a second opinion on your diagnosis or to seek for a diagnosis for those who do not have one! Also seek for a possible treatment. I was worried, but I was to ignorant to question the first doctor.Good luck to you all and I hope the person who wrote to the Doctors received an answer.",

A little unnerving to say the least!I'd also be curious to see how many people have been on birth control or are currently, doctors have said to me it could just be effects of the pill but I find this hard to believe.ALSO! finally.there are a LOT of pregnant women online that write this as one of their symtoms, and it is considered fairly normal to spot during pregnancy within the first trimester apparently? This makes me wonder how pregnancy could cause this and why we would be suffering it too?",

Turns out, not at all!I am 35, no kids, normal Paps, no STD's, doc told me years ago I most likely have Endometriosis, never had surgery for it and instead tried BCP as hormone therapy. I've always been very susceptible to yeast and bacterial infections, during which my Cervix becomes very sensitive and bleeds easily.About 7 months ago I got Mirena (IUD). Since the Mirena, I have had vaginal bleeding with bowel movements and sometimes with sex. At first I attributed it to my body adjusting to the Mirena but after several months of spotting, I knew something wasn't right. I called my OBGYN's office only to have the nurse laugh at me and mock me. Nice lady, huh?Now after reading so many comments left by so many ladies, I think my issue is the Mirena is being pushed on (by my bowels or during sex) and my Cervix or Uterus is expelling some blood. I have some pretty bad cramps along with it, which makes sense to me if my Cervix is irritated at all. Perhaps my Cervix pools a lot of blood, like some of the other ladies mentioned.This has been helpful! I hope none of you settle for just accepting it as part of being a woman. You shouldn't have to live in discomfort!!",

My gynecologist wants to insert an IUD to see if my periods will settle down, and if this doesn't work is talking about a hysterectomy. I like all of you don't feel happy when the tests come back all clear and fine, because the symptoms don't go away.

I was in agony, my bladder hurt so bad, the urge to pee was constant everyday, making it difficult to go anywhere without toilets near by.. A simple 2 mile drive to work, left me in tears, because with the urge came bladder pain.\u00a0\u00a0On top of all that the bleeding got heavier, it did eventually stop for a few days , but after a hard bowel movement it started bleeding again.\u00a0\u00a0 I have been through hell since January, my back is still agony, I'm having physio at hospital but it's doing nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I cry myself to sleep.After seeing an Urologist, I was put on a 2 week course of Trimethoprim which finished last week and now I'm on a 6 month course to kill the infection in my bladder. (Even though no infection is showing).\u00a0\u00a0Very confusing..\u00a0\u00a0Now I need to solve my bleeding, it's everyday, sometimes very lightly, sometimes it stops. When I pass a hard stool, or even strain to go, on wipe the tissue is covered in blood and clots. it's scary as he'll.\u00a0\u00a0 toilet bowl is bright red.. I'm going back to docs to have some more swabs taken and a pelvic exam. Fingers crossed ill get an answer but I'm not holding much hope. X",

My periods were always regular and the bleeding in between is a daily occurance, however i have noticed the blood is heavier and bright red when i have a bout of constipation or pass a hard BM. I have been to four different doctors, referred to two different gynos, one said endemeterious, then said it was not that, the other said ovarian cysts on either ovary however they are to small to remove, I am booked in for a further blood test this week as the last CA125 blood test was unusually high. I have now noticed my periods have stopped on the normal due date started to come 2 weeks later that happened last month and again i have passed the original date this month so expecting it this week about 18th will wait and see.I also had one doctor say it could be the start of menopause. I am trying natural remedies which has stopped the blood during the day but its there when i wake up and have first bowel movement and now stools have been soft for 3 weeks. I take raw natural coconut oil 1 Tea spoon every day and 1 tea spoon of Munukka honey 15+ UMF, I have cut out sugar in tea mostly all junk food, especially fried food from takeaways this seems to help with general health around and the weight just seems to stay off something good out of this depressing situation hope this helps other sufferers",

I had PID when I was 18, then also had a miscarriage and a D&C. When I was 19 I got a pos HPV at my pap. They did a cone biopsy on my cervix and LEEP surgery and I never had another pos test. I had my first child at 22 and my second at 31. I also have IBS and am overweight.I am a married 37yo with a 15yo and a 6yo. This same thing started with me a little over a year ago. About a week or so before my period, when I have a BM I bleed. Sometimes it's a lot, sometimes it's a little, but I always have dull ache cramps to go with it. I also have a tilted uterus. I was on birth control when it started, the SAME birth control I had been on since my son was born, but my obgyn said it was just breakthrough bleeding. I stopped the birth control in August of last year and it is still happening. I have read that sometimes antidepressants can cause it, but the two that I am on (Celexa and Wellbutrin) are on the 'least likely to cause those side effects' list. My grandmother, aunt, and mother all had to have hysterectomies in their late 30's and early 40's so I hope that it is nothing too bad.",

    "question": "I have Endomertiosos and another condition called Adenomyosis. I have been plagued by the symptoms from those problems for years now. But recently I have a new symptom and I am worried. A few months ago I started bleeding vaginaly during a bowel movement which still happends often...it also happends during and after intercourse. I have been tested for STD's and everything was all negative I have even had an ultrasound done and nothing. I am waiting to get a pap done. Anyways I am sooo frusterated and have been reading alot about cervical cancer so now I am scared that I might be having symptoms of cervical cancer. But I am also thinking it may just be the endometriosis or that other thing. I did have Human Papiloma Virus years ago...no problems for about 9 years now. Can anyone give me any insight???? I have also been extremely fatigued and have alot of lower back pain. I just don't know what to do and the doctors are not taking me serious. Please help!!!!!",
