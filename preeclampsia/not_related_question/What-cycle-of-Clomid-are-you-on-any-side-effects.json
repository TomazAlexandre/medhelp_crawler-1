I'm on CD 10 of my first 50mg Clomid cycle since 2008. (Everytime I take it CD 3-7). Again no side effects. I did notice that my BBT is higher this cycle than last (non-clomid cycle). I'm hoping to get my OPK today, too. Oh and as a side note, we have been ttc since end of 2006 and just took a break during 2009.",

Then we went on to get some dinner and while we were waiting for our cook (Japanese steakhouse) I started having this surreal feeling, like if I was in a dream; it lasted about 10-15 min, then I was fine except for some hot flashes. Then this morning I woke up around 4am to go to the restroom and I was so dizzy I could barely walk.\u00a0\u00a0Has anybody felt that before? I guess the good thing is that I know clomid is having an effect on me, hopefully a good effect!",

I have been reading all of the posting and I am glad to know that there are other women out there who are going through silimar things. I am about 4 wk out, I had my last pd on March 4. started the clomid on day 3. I spoted for the first 3 days, then became hevy for 3 days, then spotted again for 3 more days. A total of 10 of bding. 2 days go by and nothing. Then i start spotting, very very little, maybe 2 spots of pinkish blood. I took clomid for 5 days. This time around I was taking 150 mg daily. I had tried Clomid last year, and M/C my son at 7 months. After all the spotting, my husband and I, had our fun everyday for the week followed. I should note that when I was spotting, I didn't know I was having my pd, I thought it was just spotting after intercourse. So the week before and after were pretty much everyday of baby dancing. Now I am sitting here 4 wks letter and I am having the worest time ever!!! 2 wks ago, The middle of March, I started with just my really nausea, light headed. Thought it was just the side effects of the medication. Then I started with a couple of days of heart burn\u2026umm ok? Then I went 4 days of just \u201cmorning sickness\u201d. And feeling nauses, light headed all day long. Meanwhile I am going very frequently to the restroom. Now I looked myself in the mirror 2 wks ago, and I noticed that my breast were just a little perky and getting really swallow. I just put it as ok side effects! Now my menstrual cycle came natural this time. But I hadn\u2019t had a menstrual cycle since December 2009. I took urine test all have come back negative.\u00a0\u00a0Also now, I just don\u2019t know when to take the test to see, nor what is going on. I called my doctor and he is out of the country on Vacation. GREAT!!\u00a0\u00a0I am feeling so sick, and my breast hurt to the point that I would be more then happy to rip them off (sorry if I offened anyone), but that is to the point they are hurting. Dose anyone have any information on how long the side effects of Clomid should last?",

I read this some where and you will have some effects due to the hormones in your body to make things ready for with baby.Now if your late a least a week late from AF you should test but due a blood test with your doc just to make sure.I wish you luck and I hope its that your with child....SSBD and welcome to the clomid family..",

I don\u2019t know when to test, because I have been irregular, for the past 6 months. December , I had a cycle for 16 days. Then nothing until March 4th. Yesterday night, I feel asleep and for some reason I ended up sleeping on my stomach and I felt this crazy \u201cbutterfly\u201d feeling. Which made me wake up, I thought my dog was under me or something(sometimes she jumps on the bed and gets under the covers). I am not sure,\u00a0\u00a0when to test because this past month in March I was bleeding from March 4th until the March 13th. Then it stopped and then March 15 & 16th spotting but barly! So should I just wait until the 15th or 16th? I don\u2019t want to make myself crazy, because I feel as though, you can make yourself feel and act pregnant.

I have been having hot flashes like crazy, well now in my office I have a fan on me really all the time. But I had to buy a new bra cause these bad girls are on a different world that I am on right now.(I did that at lunch after my bra popped when coming into work) Last week I fealt bloated, LOL i looked like I was 5 mo prego. I was like OH NO! this week bloating is gone, but the girls are really bothering me to touch, to put clothes on them, to shower. Sick feeling, but then again it can be all in my head.

Its still no indication of pregnancy, but the number does spike after ovulation, and should continue to climb if your are pregnant, because thats what creates a womb to maintain the fetus. If you don't get preg. your body stops production of progesterone and you have af a week later. I'm still so excited mine was that high this month.... can't wait to test :0)",

Oh and something funny happened to me yesterday, DH got some chinese food ( I loathe it) and he gave me a fortune cookie that said \"A small lucky package is on its way to you soon\" :0) WOW I was shocked lol.Amandamae1126: I'm not sure, but I think that long of an AF would help shed old lining and eggs, the provera is just progesterone. you take it, then when you go off, it signals an AF in your body. I would ask your dr. to make sure your lining isn't too thinned out so that implantation can occur. What cocktail of meds are you on now?I'm really feeling positive about this thread and I'm really feeling like that we're going to see a lot of BFPs soon (Hoping that I am definitely one of them) GOOD LUCK SSBD!!!",

            "answer": "Good luck to all of you in the tww... I can't wait for this cycle to be over and test myself. I'm on day 16 and have not ovulated yet. I've been doing OPK's but no + yet. I'm hoping to get there sometime this weekend.Yesterday, I was so moody, I was so angry for no reason, and I knew that anything I could come up to be upset about was not worth being upset about but I couldn't help it. I then realized it was probably the clomid messing with my hormones, but I still couldn't let it go. DH was so sweet, he came into the room and even though I yelled at him and said I wanted to be alone he just stayed by my side until I felt better. I'm so blessed. We had a talk after that and he mentioned I needed to slow down and not be so consumed about having a baby, and having it NOW! hehe. He sad he loved me even if we could never have a baby, even though we haven't been trying for that long yet (>1yr). Being reminded of that and that I am loved makes me feel so much better.I'm trying not to work myself up with this being pregnant thing, but I want it so bad. I want to be a mom, I want to know how it feels to have my baby inside me and care for it before it even comes into the world.Needless to say I'll try to relax and trust that God has a time for everything and no matter how much I want something and try to get it, it's still going to happen on HIS time not mine.Lots of baby dust for all of us.. I hope we all get our BFP pretty soon. Just remember to relax and trust always, I think sometimes we get so carried away with our feelings (and messed up hormones/emotions) that we forget what it's all about.",

I have been on and off clomid 7 times and I know these pills are no joke. This is the first time I have been on them 3 months in a row and every time is a different effect. I understand your pain but think of it like this it will all pay out in the long run. I wish you luck and SSBD your way. And welcome to our lil clomid family.CarlisMaMa- Welcome to our Clomid family I wish you the best on this round. SSBD",

    "question": "Hello everyone I think that this form will be very helpful for all that are on Clomid or that will start Clomid soon.Let me start by saying that I have PCOS and I have 11 year old daughter I have been TTC on and off the last 7 years but since I been married a year ago we been trying faithfully. I was on Clomid in Nov. 2009 I was taking 50mg 3-7cd I was told that I didnt O on this round and that I would need to go up on my next round. Dec came and went no AF so went in to see if I was Pergo but no I was not so they put me on provrea then Clomid on 3-7 100mg. I am now on my 3 and last round of Clomid I am on 150mg 3-7 days and I hope that this time I O because on my last round they told me I O early on cd 15 I have never O in 11 years so that was a good thing. But doc said that the numbers where not where he wanted them to be at so that is why he up my clomid this time.As for side effects on 50mg I had mood swings and hot flashes and the wonderful headaches... On 100mg I thank god I did not have any but did have crazy dreams with them. And with 150mg I had the vision problems. I just hope that this time works.Would love to hear your stories on Clomid and hear how long before you got your BFP on Clomid...",
