            "answer": "They can check for protein in your urine you may be starting to get preeclampsia and that's a sign of it. If they find any they may give you a container to pee in for 24 hours and see how much protein there is. My friend had to do this twice and they finally induced her because there was so much protein. You can still be at risk w/o the high blood pressure! Hope its not but keep us updated!!",
