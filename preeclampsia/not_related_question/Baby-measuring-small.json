My first one was micropreemie too due to preeclampsia, stopped growing at 24 weeks and we didn't catch it until week 28, that's when I had to have c-section too.Now, with my second pregnancy my baby kept measuring small (in the 20th percentile) until about week 38. My due date is tomorrow and she is measuring in the 55th percentile now)) I'm getting worries she might even be too big lol.So if your OB is not concerned, you should be ok.",
