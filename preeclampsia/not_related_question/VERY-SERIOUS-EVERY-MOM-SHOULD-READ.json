This sounds extremely inaccurate, the meeting I had with my nurse had gone into detail about this and nothing you just said was included into that conversation. I'm glad you and your baby are ok but I don't think you have the correct diagnosis. The urine sample they take at every visit is used to help determine if you have diabetes, kidney disease, or a bladder infection by measuring the levels of sugar, protein, bacteria, or other substances in your urine.

Told me when she was doing the test (when i was 35wks) that they test for it more often now than before. Because years back women werent being tested for this and would end up getting sick off of serious sicknesses and die. If you get hooked up to the IV. Your baby should be fine because along with that medicine and your antibiotics you pass on to the baby. Im not saying its nothing serious bcause any percentage of anything bad is worth looking into. But, dont freak out. Now a days modern science and good doctors are your first line of battle and are very well informed.Best of luck to you all, im due anyday now!

And I've always been tested for group b strep in all if my pregnancies.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that it's routine to be cautious because you don't have symptoms of it if you do in fact have it. I don't think that this is something to take lightly at all, by all means better safe than sorry, but misinformation is just as bad as not having the information at all. The reasons I think Dr's don't make a huge deal out of it is because they are or at least should be routine checking all of their prenatal patients and is totally treatable when caught. I'm sure that there have been more serious cases that have led to stillborn births but I'm sure those are extreme cases and could possibly have had other complications.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone is concerned about it then the best thing would be to speak directly to your dr and get the information from them.",

Im telling you truth uou can argue with me over me just trying to warn moms to take this serious and atleast get tested so they can protect their baby over and over again but unless you actually look it up and do research on this then stop being so insensitive because unlike most of you i dont think babies dying over something that can be treated if known should happen so yes ima continue spreading the word cause every mom needs to know this and this is a serious\u00a0\u00a0thing. Because many moms were not informed about this their babies died im 27 weeks as of monday i started taking probiotics to help my baby so moms if they deny you the test say it can cause premiee labor and if you do have premiee labor make sure you ask to be tested to help your baby and if you dont have it thank god",

As far as GBS goes if there were any possibilities of it getting into your blood stream during pregnancy I could se the risk of miscarriage. But if you tested positive and get treatment like its recommended in labor you and the baby will be fine but if it goes undetected and during labor when the baby is coming out and gets in contact with the bacteria the results could be detrimental and even fatal. But I wouldn't exactly believe everything you believe in the internet because it's not all true. Now encyclopedias are medical books that have been published those are good sources. A little old school but they had to be correct before being published. But good luck to all you moms and prayers for safe and healthy babies for you all :)",

I'm allergic to that and I don't remember any of the reaserch I read saying that, but then again most of them just said that the doctors will provide an iv to prevent the infant from catching it on the way out. And to the poster, your doctor is SUPPOSED to test you between 34-37 weeks. If they didn't test you or refused to you need a new doctor. Quite frankly I think you need a new one any way and new places of \"research\" because you're still the only person saying the things that you are. What are the odds that EVERYONE but you, INCLUDING these women's doctors, have the wrong info and you are the ONLY one with the right one? Seriously, mothers have enough things to worry about with their pregnancy as is, providing information like this that apparently only you can find or have been told is seriously messed up. A lot of us have been tested properly. Have talked to our doctors. Have done our research. Yet we are still incorrect? Yeah...doesn't seem logical to me.",

I just found out i have this bacterial infection and im horrified but i'm grateful I found out early before my due date. I had never even heard of this and i had to go to the emergency labor room for them to test me on this my baby could have died because my obgyn found a lil bit of protein in my urine and dismissed it. Thankfully those doctors didnt. Please be safe then sorry and make your obgyn check if you have this bacterial infection so proper precautions can be taken to save your childs life many moms have never heard of this or know that this infection mostly causes no symptoms until its to late. I have no symptoms i went in for food poisoning but had them run test on me. Im grateful i went. Many moms get still borns from this and if their babies get the infection many complications occur even death but it can be prevented during labor please check.",
