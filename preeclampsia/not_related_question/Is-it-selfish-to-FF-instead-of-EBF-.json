I eat healthy and enough to produce what my little girl needs.Just because your first experience wasn't the greatest doesn't mean your next baby is going to be the same. Just like every pregnancy is different so is every baby and how they grow and thrive.My DD is on the petite side she's only in the 25 percentile. She is gaining weight and growing and I'm fine with that. I know she is getting the correct nutrients by her growing and thriving.Yes BF is the best for your baby but it's not always the best for every mother. You wont be looked down on for formula feeding your baby. The only thing that matters is you doing the best for your child.",

I Tried my Darndest to make more for her, pumping every 2 hours for an hour but still only maybe producing an ounce per pumping session. When I WAS a GREAT Producer While Pregnant with her. and when I couldnt BF her It made me feel like such a Failure. Finally I just gave up, because I knew she wasnt getting everything she needed and switched her to formula, she HAD to go on SImilac RX, because all other kinds hurt her really bad. BTW I was only able to BF for 3 weeks.My Point is YOU know what is best for YOUR baby and Yourself. wheather that be to BF or FF. Do what you think is right.",

I don't FF so I don't know all the details but make sure you check out other formula companies but I would assume none of them are sterile, not to mention bug parts and engine oil (or whatever it was) has been found in formula.In the end it is your baby and your choice.

I EBF my first and he gained so much very quickly which was great but I will admit I was in so much pain for the first 5-6 months and cringed every time he would latch even though everyone said he was latched properly. I wanted to give up, seriously. But I made it to 11 months (because I got preggo when he was 8 1/2 months) and then he started eating table food. With my second, BFing was perfect! Hardly any pain! But then of course with all of his issues I had to start supplementing with special formula (which he never liked and ended up BFing more anyway) But it was then I understood why some women need to supplement, so I look at formula with different eyes now, because I used to be so against it. But I know it is needed sometimes. My son could not gain ANY weight on my milk alone, it was heartbreaking.But I would just say, try to BF first and see where it goes from there. I could never lose weight as quickly as most women say they do when they EBF, so I understand, it's frustrating! I am hoping to EBF and lose weight this time around. I am going to stick to a high protein diet and drinks TONS of water to make up for the exercising.",

Each baby truly is different. And you can totally workout and lose weight while nursing. I can't wait to hear how little one does and what you decide to do!

    "question": "Hi Ladies.... With DD, she was Exclusively Breast Fed for five months. She was not a good eater, constantly had to be relatched and ate for five minutes at a time. Also I gained about 60 lb with her, about 30 lb was lost within two wks, and 10 more lost was \"fat\"..... I never bothered losing the next 20 lb bc we knew we wanted our babies close in age.... (never thought it would take a good year to concieve- being perfectly healthy and young)ANYWAYS.... looking that BF was a great way to bond, its wonderful for babies health, but DD still suffered from 10+ ear infections in the last two years... Hasnt had a single one this past winter (Thank you Jesus!!!)I know its the best that I can do, I know Ill probably be looked down on and frowned upon by you \"green\" women. But It isnt exactly pie seeing myself/going from a 3-5 to a size 9 .... YES i ate healthy, my body just reacted poorly to my first pregnancy. I wasnt allowed to do much in terms of excersize bc of HBP.Am I wrong to want to go on a good diet, excersize to lose my weight and to get fit? Am I wrong for wanting to give my little one formula? My DD was given formula from 5-12 months, shes alive and healthy. And I dont regret it, it was a lot, from things said to me about how \"little\" she is, perhaps she wasnt getting what she needs from me, when in actuality shes still a poor and picky eater, just caused me so much stress with BF and later on I wondered if she wouldve gained more if she were on formula. (I KNOW SHE WASNT starved.) Shes just a petite little peanut. Shes got the brain of four kids i tell you!Sorry for the vent/questions.... I just am looking for reassurance that my lo will be just fine no matter what I chose to feed him.And YES Ive heard BF \"helps\" you lose the weight. Apparently didnt work for me.",
