            "answer": "This happens to me. I'll post the info my OB has posted online about it. It's really common, and I've actually passed out from it. If you're having migraines and swelling along with protein in your urine and high bp...then it's preeclampsia.Many pregnant women complain of dizziness and lightheadedness throughout their pregnancies. Fainting is rare but does happen even in some healthy pregnant women. There are many reasons for these symptoms. The growth of more blood vessels in early pregnancy, the pressure of the expanding uterus on blood vessels and the body's increased need for food all can make a pregnant woman feel lightheaded and dizzy.To feel better follow these tips:Stand up slowly.When you're feeling lightheaded, lay down on your left side.Avoid sitting or standing in one position for a long time.Eat healthy snacks or small meals frequently.Don't get overheated.Call your doctor as soon as possible if you faint. Dizziness or lightheadedness can be discussed at regular prenatal visits.",

Shes never had me use the bathroom so she could check for protein either.. I see her tomorrow at 12 an im going to be bringing all this up but my question is do you ladys think this could be a sign of pre eclamsia or just part of pregnancy? my hubby nor i understand whats going on with me its gotten to the point were im scared to get off the couch an do anything",
