            "answer": "I was 40+5 and actually went to my dr that morning for a routine appt. We made plans to induce that following Monday (I would've been 11 days overdue). I was feeling super depressed and do my hubby phones me from work and told me he made me an appontment to get a pedicure at 2:30 to get out and relax. It was about 2:00 PM and I'm laying on the couch and I started to get slight cramping that spread to my back. It was about every 5 mins. I was in denial and didn't think it was real so I still went to my appointment at 2:30 lol. By the end of my appointment at 3:30 I was having about 3 contractions every 10 mins. I rushed home and told my hubby I think I'm actually in labor cause they were getting quite painful. We packed our stuff and left for the hospital and sure enough I was 4 cms dilated and in active labor. By the time I got to the hospital I was having contractions come on very quickly at about a minute apart. I was in a lot of pain and asked for an epidural but the anesthesiologist was in surgery and I had to wait till 6:00 to get it!!! That was the longest 2 hrs of my life! Once I got the epidural it was so much better. By 7:30 I had the urge to push and at 9:05 pm on June 4 I had my little girl! I was pushing for an hour and a half and she was stuck off to the side so they had to vacuum assist her out. I ended up getting a third degree tear and was in a lot of pain from stitches afterwards (it took an hour to stitch me up). But it was all worth it!! :)",

            "answer": "My baby was due Nov 12 2012. I had my baby shower on Sunday Oct 7 2012. The following day I had a dr appointment, just a regular check up. When they checked my BP, it was VERY high. They told me I had preeclampsia and the only way to \"cure\" it was to deliver my baby. My mom was with me and she was all freaking out, but I was beyond calm. I was moved into a room and was told I couldnt eat. Which sucked because I hadn't eaten since the day before at my baby shower. And I was so hungry! So they kept me over night and told me they'd induce me first thing in the morning. 7am, Oct 9th 2013, the dr came and popped my water and all that good stuff and it was a waiting game from there. My family pointed out how huge my contractions were getting on the little machine I was hooked up to, but I didnt feel anything. Even the nurses were like are you sure you can't feel that? Lol So around 330, I was finally getting closer to being dilated and they gave me my epidural.\u00a0\u00a0Once they gave me the epidural the contractions really hit me. Before I knew it the dr was in the room and was propping me up to push. I gave two good pushes and the baby was nearly all the way out. One last push for the shoulders and my baby had finally arrived. He didnt cry or anything. When they handed him to me he just stared at me while they cleaned him off. I didnt get all emotional or anything like I thought I would. I remember saying you're here! And I couldnt get the huge smile off my face. Well they took him to get checked, since he was delivered at 35 weeks (5 lb 6 oz, 17 in long). They came back and told me his sugars and iron were very low, he had jaundice and they weren't going to bring him back to my room, they were putting him in the NICU. I got to hold my baby for about 5 minutes right after he was born and then they took him :/ I was crushed. Bc I had stitches they didnt want me moving around so for the next 2 days I didnt get to see my baby. All I did was cry. When I was finally able to get up, me and my boyfriend (babys father) went down to see him.He had been going to see him soso he knew the whole routine, ring the bell, they let you in, scrub your hands VERY well, and then you can see your baby. He was hooked to all kinds of machines. And he had this material wrapped around his eyes, it was shaped like sunglasses, and he was under a lamp. He looked like he was tanning out on the beach. They let me change and feed him and take him a bath, which he did not like, lol. It was amazing. That night they released me from the hospital and my baby had to stay. It was the hardest thing to do. I went home and broke down bc all his baby shower gifts were all over our room. Hes all I thought about. I cried and cried. And we lived far from the hospital so I was only able to go up there once a day :/ My baby lost weight from being under the lamp at the hospital (went down to 4 lb 13 oz) and they didnt want to release him until he gained some weight back. So finally, on Oct 17 2012 we were able to take our baby home. It was the greatest feeling ever. I have grown so attatched to him. He is now 8 months, will be 9 months July 9th 2013. Oh, and I named him Andrew :)",

He said I would prob have to be induced the next week. I was so crushed I got a little depressed. But then on tues night I decided to walk to the store to get some clemintines and I had pains as soon as I got back I didn't know if they were contractions or not because they were not very regular. So I went to bed and didn't bother telling my bf because I didn't want him to get worked up. I woke up at 2am having pain and I happened to look at the time and I had another within 5 min. I just timed my contractions which were not bad at all for an hour when they were two min apart I woke him up. They still didn't hurt bad until we were at the hospital at 4am. I was only 3cm still but contractions were really painful and one min apart.\u00a0\u00a0We walked around about 20min then I went back and was at 5cm they broke my water at 6am. I got pain meds cuz had to wait for epi until 8. Got my epidural and i was fully dialated. The nurse had me do a practice push and she saw the babys head ao i had to stop.But doc had a csection to do so I had to wait to push since I wasn't having the urge to push or any pain I didn't mind I just slept. The doc didn't get there until 1:50 I started pushing at exactly 2 and 3 pushes and 4 min later my daughter peyson was born! I had a few stitches and was up walking in an hour",
