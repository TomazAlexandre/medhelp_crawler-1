If any of the symptoms come back make sure you call your doctor asap.",

    "question": "I'm 38 weeks and just spent 24 hours at the L&B for having \"stroke-like\" symptoms. Yesterday I started seeing blurry from one eye with strong numbness in my hand. What followed was the scariest though as my speech got slurred, I was totally unable to form sentences! I've had these optic migraines kind of symptoms a few times in the past few weeks but it's the first time my speech got slurred so my doctor recommended I head to the ER. They did a million tests and I'm neurologically perfect so they couldn't put a final diagnosis on it. I feel good just tired and thankfully baby is 100% OK! Anyone experience this during their pregnancy? I'm frustrated they were unable to find out what it was though obviously I'm thankful all seems OK :)",
