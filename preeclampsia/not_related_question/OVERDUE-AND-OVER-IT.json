            "answer": "It could be that you are at the early stages of labor, and the cramps you are feeling were actually contractions. I know that before I went into labor I felt this pressure on my lower back and period like cramps. These cramps as they progressed kept getting more and more uncomfortable, not painful but uncomfortable. They would come in waves and then disappear. Good Luck and best wishes you are getting close :]",

            "answer": "Ok so i should be getting up and trying to keep the contractions coming... but everytime i go to bed thats when they go away it happened again yesterday they start to come again at night and are going for like a couple of hours.. i try to stay up and bounce on the ball and count them and they were still coming at every 10mins then 7mins... and they were more painful than the first night.. then nothing..?? Im still noticing lots of blood tinged discharge but sometimes i will feel just a big blob come out and its just the discharge.... could i maybe be leaking fluid? Would i definately know if that was happening?",

If you just have a slight tear the leakage would be small and could be disguised by the discharge/mucus plug.\u00a0\u00a0A trip to L & D for a swab test could tell you for sure.\u00a0\u00a0I would definitely try to keep walking and doing as much activity as you can during the day.\u00a0\u00a0But make sure to get your rest as well.\u00a0\u00a0An exhausted Mommy doesn't make for an easy labor.\u00a0\u00a0It can actually hinder labor and cause it to stall so get plenty of rest too.\u00a0\u00a0Do house work, finish getting things ready for the baby.\u00a0\u00a0Whatever keeps you occupied and moving :)",

            "answer": "If you see blood tinged discharge it could be your bloody show, and as far as the leaking fluid it might be your bag of waters breaking. When I went into labor I felt and heard like a pop and a little water trickled out. Within 20 minutes it became gushes coming out as if I were peeing myself, but I just couldn't stop it from coming out. Like the\u00a0\u00a0Losing said, a trip to L&D would help, to make sure if it really is fluid.",

            "answer": "also I was late with my first two kids. if you are overdue you can induce your own laborwith physical stimulation as long as you have not and still dont have any pregnancy complication, such as preeclampsia, breech birth meaning the baby is feet down or the cord is not in a dangerous position etc. i am a big believer of natural medicine. a friend of mine who delivered my also late 2nd child told me that when the doctor gives you pitocin to induce your labor it can cause complications. but if you are already in labor then your labor stops then it is considered safer for you to use the pitocin. the doctor also said that within a few hours if your waterbag has not broken then they have to break it for you. as i said earlier i was late with my first two. my daughter was 2 weeks and a day late and my son was a week and a day late. they had to induce me with both babies. then my midwife tells me when i ended up pregnant with my 3rd that it is perfectly safe to use physical stimulation as long as there are not any complications. and thats how my 3rd was born 2 days before his due date. all of this eccept infection I have gone through. so I am speaking from experience. now I am 6 weeks and 4 days according to ultrasound with twins.",
