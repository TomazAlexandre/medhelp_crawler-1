            "answer": "Well I was checked for preeclampsia awhile back and my doctor said it was just regular pregnancy swelling. It's just hard to elevate my wrist while I'm asleep. I think a lot of it has to do with me sleeping on my hands",

            "answer": "I'm the same way, but both my hands and my feet. My blood pressure is fine so my doctor isn't worried and just tells me to keep hydrated and elevate. The swelling never goes away, but it certainty gets worse when it's hot and/or I'm standing up a lot.My feet swell so much they start tingling and go numb. When I get up to pee in the middle of the night the pressure makes it feel like I have a split in my toe, along the bottom, and it's going to burst open. My husband tries to rub my feet but the tops feel bruised. I noticed today that one of my toes is very sore and tender; I stubbed it really hard a week or so ago, so I think I broke it. And my hands are so swollen and stiff that I can't close them all the way to make a fist, and I can't grip very hard. If I work at it I can get them closed but then they are stuck that way and it hurts to open them! But I have less than 3 weeks to my due date. Hopefully the swelling goes down soon after Baby is born.",
