Some contractions start at the top of your uterus.The other upper abdominal pain it could be is high blood pressure(preeclampsia).\u00a0\u00a0Could you check your blood pressure at home? Or like cvs?I think the easiest thing to do is wait it out and see if the possible contractions get stronger or closer together. But don't risk your babies health! If you need to go, go! Your husband would want you to put the baby's safety and yours first.",
