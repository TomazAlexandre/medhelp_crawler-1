            "answer": "Its possible you could have a crack or fracture on a rib(s). I talked to my doctor about this just this week. Also the ligament supporting your ribs could be stretched causing pain.\u00a0\u00a0Depending on how you carry this may happen.\u00a0\u00a0A baby's kick can also cause damage. I fractured mine due to a bad cough from bronchitis over Christmas and its painful.\u00a0\u00a0If that it takes about 6 weeks to heal. Mention to your doc but not much they can do.\u00a0\u00a0Once baby drops hopefully you will have relief.",

Both sides got sore & painful later at night. I been applying ice, helped little bit. My blood pressure was fine. So it's most like the baby it's pushing on that area. I wish I was done with this pregnancy. Thanks ladies :-)",
