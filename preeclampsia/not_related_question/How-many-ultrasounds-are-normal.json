Personally I enjoy seeing the ultrasound of my kiddos but I definitely think it's unnecessary to have so many if you and your baby are healthy and no complaints",

            "answer": "First, the ultrasound needs to be medically indicated. And second, if you are low risk and without maternal medical issues, I would say about 3 scans. Your 12 weeker for dating purposes, a 20 week anatomy survey, and a third trimester (about 32 weeks) growth scan for estimated weight, position, and amniotic fluid check. This is assuming an uncomplicated pregnancy. If you were to develop GDM, for example, you would have more scans.",
