            "answer": "I bought new insoles for my most comfortable pair of shoes and compression socks. Even though I'm on my feet most of the 8 hours I'm at work I still make sure to sit down for a while whether anyone likes it or not. Then when I get home I prop my feet up on a pillow and try to stay off my feet as much as possible. It helps but I've noticed as long as I work on my feet all night, I'm going to get swollen. My doctor said it's just one of those things and as long as there aren't signs of preeclampsia then there's no need to worry. Just make yourself as comfortable as you can.",

            "answer": "Well I'm 34-3 and I have the same problem I work 9 hours a day the only break I get is my day off...my friend at work suggested mommy socks..I've yet to try them but I suppose you could look them up. Best I got is good shoes and maybe some inserts when stand for long periods. And make sure to elevate your feet when you have time to relaxed cause all the blood goes to your feet when you stand for long periods.\u00a0\u00a0Also try to keep up with blood pressure cause really bad swelling could mean high blood pressure and I'm sure you wouldn't want problems with that. Try soaking your feet as well in some warm water.",
