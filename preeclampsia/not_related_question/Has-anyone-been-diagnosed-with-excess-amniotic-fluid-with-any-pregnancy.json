            "answer": "I have the same thing,this is my second time around with having alot of fluid. With this pregnancy i have way more fluid then i had with my last one. They told me my little girl looks good,they thought maybe she wasn't drinking and peeing enough but from what they could tell she was doing both jest fine... The only other thing is if i have diabetes, that causes extra fluid.. i haven't took my sugar test yet to rule that out... but i don't think its that either... My doctor said he's really not to worried about it,the only thing he worries about if i reach to much fluid in my water will break way to early for my little girl to be born... They say the normal amount for a women is 24 and im at 27 right now... so that's why i was diagnosed with it. Im jest waiting it out to see what happens,want my little girl breaking alot longer then jest 25 weeks... I hope this helped you... I wouldn't worry over it..",

            "answer": "I went to the high risk obgyn yesterday. Luckily based on our anatomy scans and glucose test he said that we were fine. He mentioned that when AFI is above 40 that would be a time to be a little more concerned. My AFI seemed to drop a bit from its originally high 36.6 value. So all is good. He mentioned it can happen with boys just due to gender, not sure how he has that correlated factor in mind. Thanks ladies for your input, I don't know anyone who personally is going through it. It's nice to find similar mommas out there to swap stories. Glad our babies will be ok.",
