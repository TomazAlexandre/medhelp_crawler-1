            "answer": "Hi there,I cannot confirm anything without a complete medical history and clinical examination. There are several conditions which can mimic seizures like a syncope, parasomnias, and movement disorders. There is a condition called psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (PNES) in which there are sudden and time-limited disturbances of motor, sensory, autonomic, cognitive, and/or emotional functions, these are psychogenically determined. Other conditions mimicking seizures are conversion disorder, panic attacks and migraine attacks. Sometimes a video EEG may be recommended which records EEG pattern during a particular time period. It is also advisable to rule out preeclampsia. Do discuss these possibilities with your doctor. I hope it helps.Best luck and regards!",
