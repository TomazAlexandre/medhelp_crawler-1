I'm really looking forward to having a scheduled one with this pregnancy because it was a really calm way to bring my baby into the world.

Your babies heartrate will be off and you will be experiencing tummy pain so at that point you go to or and get baby out asap before you even tear possibly. Only time life treating is complete ruprure and failure to get baby out within 20_30 minutes. I would read more and get a second option from a Doctor bc I have seen three obs now to pick the right one for my vbac and all have told me this.",

With my blood pressure still so crazy and everything, I had already decided a c section was the route I was gonna go I just wanted to hear different experiences with scheduled and emergency. I'm really nervous but I would rather have a game plan this time rather than trying again (36 hours last time and never dilated pa st 3) and having the emergency c section. I know that it's always a possibility but I just feel like going for a vbac would not be the best idea for us.",
