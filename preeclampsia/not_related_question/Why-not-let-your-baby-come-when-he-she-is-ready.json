Being induced with synthetic hormones increases your chances of haemhorraging because the fake hormone binds to oxytocin receptors and only oxytocin helps your uterus to contract afterwards... So with being induced you just don't get the oxytocin you need.My midwife is happy for me to go 14days plus overdue if I get ultrasounds to check that there is enough fluid and that the placenta is working well...Bring induced has its place - if I developed preeclampsia or my baby was in danger from low fluid or a dodgy umbilical cord I would absolutely go for it.",
