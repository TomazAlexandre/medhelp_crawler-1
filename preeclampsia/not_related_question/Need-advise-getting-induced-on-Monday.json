            "answer": "I was induced 2 months ago and it was due to medical reasons. I wanted to have our son come on his own so I could experience what that is like. I wanted my husband and I to rush out the door and call everyone to let them know we were on our way to the hospital. Although I didn't get to have that moment, it was the best decision I was induced. If there is no medical reason why they would prefer to induce you, the plus side to it is you can let everyone know when your little one should arrive. Whoever wants to be there with you will know in advance on the date. The downside is, from what I've heard (this was my first), being induced hurts more than going into labor naturally. I can understand that because the medicine is forcing your body to go into labor. Also, you are picking your child's birthday instead of them doing it on their own. I do think you should ask why they would like to induce you and weigh the pros and cons. Good luck and best wishes!",

Plus I had a crummy experience getting induced 1 day before my edd, it ended in a cesarean bc I want ripe enough abd I stopped dilating at 8cm. Untimely him it's your choice though. I just know I wouldn't do it. Good luck in whatever you decide :-)",

            "answer": "I was induced at 37weeks 5days with my daughter who is now almost 11 yrs. I had preeclampsia and was really swollen and a ton of back pain. I think it was actually better being induced, they left the pitocin going on me afterward and this actually helps the uterus contract back down to original size faster and reduced the time of bleeding afterward also. My baby girl weighed 6lbs 14oz. 20 inches long. if the Dr is saying baby is fully grown then he might not want you to go much further bc toward the end the babies gain something like a pound a week. Did he tell you how much your baby's estimated weight/size is?",
