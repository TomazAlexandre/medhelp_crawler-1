I'm still looking for ways to lessen the intensity of these symptoms, but for me I've found that maintaining physical activity helps, as well as not oversleeping, or overeating.\u00a0\u00a0The rest of my family takes folic acid suppliments regularly. God, puberty was a nightmare, but I am much less groggy and more in focus now that I am no longer growing. I'd like to hear other peoples' experiences with this.",

It's really frusterating to hear that there is no help out there for minor patients yet as we must all be making up the same exact symptoms since the doctors all contest that their are no known symptoms for minor patients. I'm 18 and I experience excessive tiredness and also the cold hands and feet which I never quite equated with the disease until now. I also suffer from dizzy spells and I was wondering if anyone else also had these.",

My sister and my mother were also diagnosed with a low thyroid. I just had blood drawn again and they said my TSH level was low. Tsh is your Thyroid Stimulating hormone. But they said when your TSH is low that is usually a sign that you have an overactive thyroid which symtoms of that are the opposite of what we have. My Doctor has ordered more tests so I am waiting. I asked my sister to read me her TSH level from her blood work when she was diagnosed & it is the same is mine. She had been misdiagnoded in the past.I have been searching the web to see if there is a connection to Beta-Thalassemia Minor & thyroid. I have only found one that connected the two, but I am still searching.

My sleep schedule is way out of wack. some days i sleep three hours, other months twelve hours sleep days with unusual patterns that do not fit a time schedule. i may also have something called restless leg syndrome. i shake my leg a lot before sleep due to the feeling of tense inner strain in my ankles and wrists. i always thought of the shaking as due to my liking to be rocked to sleep by myself but now realize it could be due to low iron. thalassemics have low iron. i also had a psychotic break at age 20. i dont think this has to do with thalassemia but the constant fatigue may have led to deep depression.",

I was one of the best athletes in high school, winning several awards for track&field, swimming, etc. Today I am still extremely energetic.However, I have always been pale, which is most likely due to the thalassemia. I also have a tendency to feel depressed, which may or may not be related.This extreme tiredness you all experience could probably be a result of some other illness. Perhaps sleep apneia? It can cause a lot of the symptoms you have described. I know this because my brother-in-law suffered from it.I wish you all the best.",

This is in addition to an ample amount of recuperative sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I am also concerned about the connection between BTM and thyroid conditions. I eat small portions.\u00a0\u00a0Eating a \"normal\" sized plate of full makes me uncomfortable and sluggish, not to mention that I can gain weight from smelling food in the air!\u00a0\u00a0I now wear glasses to help me focus better. I also have heart palpitations.\u00a0\u00a0One thing I have a concern about and have not seen it posted are problems with your lungs.\u00a0\u00a0I typically do not catch colds or the flu...but when I get sick, it is usually in the form of bronchitis or pneumonia.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to it progressing to this state, I feel like I can not get a good, deep breath of air into my lungs. The fatigue that comes from this is astounding. Is anyone else experiencing this?",

            "answer": "Hello everyone,I was diagnosed with thallasemia minor 1 year ago. I could'nt stand the fatigue and tiredness anymore and knew something was really wrong. I took me two childbirths to finally complain about all the same symptoms all of you are complaining about. So I really believe each childbirth really took it out of me...I love to run and find it very depressing that I can't run for more than 1/2 mile without getting fatigued. It took a lot of blood work to finally find out my diagnosis. It is very frustrating for me not to be able to function like everybody else especially when there is just no cure for this horrible tiredness and fatigue. I really hate the feeling of just not feeling energized ever. I go to bed tired and get up tired. I need to take a power nap every day otherwise I am to exhausted to act normally for the rest of the day. My husband is a 4 year medical student and the first thing he said when he looked up my lab work results was: \"You are screwed!\" And the truth is we are but we just can't let this blood disorder take over our lives. I try to be positive about it every day and make the best of every day. I am quite upset that I might have passed on this disorder to\u00a0\u00a0my first born since 1 out of every 4 children born to us can get this disorder. He acts tired, out of breath and is only in the 10% on the growth chart. He will be 5 years old in September. I am so glad I am not alone and appreciate all your comments...P. S. I am from Spain and my Mom has the sam disorder.",

My face is always pale. I get dizzy spells whenever I stand up. My hands and feet are constantly cold no matter what I always have to wear heaps more layers of clothes even in the summer and when I go swimming I turn blue! Whenever I exercise my lungs feel as though they are going to rip out of my chest and I have the poorest memory sometimes I cant even remember what I had for breakfast! And the worst thing about this is I look so young everyone thinks i am either 15 or 16 which doesnt help to much when you are trying to find a job. I also always have bruises all over my body the slightest bump and I get a massive bruise. And last but not least I have had my eyes tested and apparently have near perfect vision but for some strange reason when Im driving at night I find it very difficult to see. The list goes on and I dont want to bore you all with my symptoms which according to the 'experts' there isnt any (****!)on the bright side of things im not to sure if it is true but my nonno (grand father)\u00a0\u00a0has told me that Thal actually makes you immune to maleria I guess thats a good thing in a way if its true!I think more research needs to be done for all us Thal minor victims!May God bless you all....",

My hands and feet are always cold. I seem to have depression quite often, as being tired all the time kind of points me in that downward trend. People do not understand my issues. I had a miscarriage 2 years ago and am looking forward to being pregnant again, but I am afraid that I will be SO tired that I cannot function. I also have heart palpitations. When I exercise, I tire easily and cannot seem to endure a lot. When I was a Firefighter/Paramedic I always had trouble with endurance- even when I was in tip-top shape! I crave red meat. I seem to have the best health when I sleep 8 hours + per night, eat small balanced meals with a lot of lean protien, exercise gently and regularly, keep my emotional self in check, and really just listen to my body and take care of it. When I am tired I must rest or I will become ill. For a while I had terrible recurring sinus infections. When I am under stress, I seem to get ill fast. My Mom has Thal minor and was just diagnosed with it about 5 years ago at age 60. She was adpoted and did not know her heritage. Now we know! Greek or Italian! That explains a lot. I am tired of doctor's saying that there are no syptoms for Thal minor. WE KNOW THAT IS NOT TRUE!Best of health to all- God Bless!Melissa",

I can't believe how many doctors say it's asymptomatic, it obvioualy isn't!! I'm 21 female by the way- my dad has BTM too.I get the cold hands and feet, i also get aches in my joints and bones- like sudden sharp stabbing pains, does anynoe else get these?? They happen every now and then,\u00a0\u00a0usually ever day..I get REALLY dizzy when i stand up- i thought it was maybe posteral hypotension (my blood pressure is often low) but thinking about it now, it's probably just the thal minor...I get tired after i eat and i guess thats cos all our blood goes to the digestive organs... i am aaaaaaalllllllwwwaaayyyysssss tired!!!!! ans i'm SO sick of it!!I get emotional and depressed quite easily, yet theres always a part of me that just wants to get out there and do stuff anf run around and be care free and positive but everytime i try i end up making myself ill from exhaustion!!!I was in a house fire a few years back (not anything major, the tv caught fire whilst we were alseep and there was a lot of smoke) but we were taken to hospital in an ambulance to check for carbon monoxide in the blood etc) and on the way they gave me a mask with pure oxygen and i have never felt so awake in my life!!! It's such a sill tiny thing, that nobody would probably remember... but for me it was amazing, everything just suddenly went crystal clear, everything was so different! It was like i was actually properly wide awake, not all groggy like usual.Anyway, enough of that... i just thought i'd mention it as it upsets me to think that normal people feel like that 100% of the time and yet we are all coping the way we are- and being told by doctors that we are fine when we clearly aren't.I hope everyone is ok and i was thinking of starting up some kind of BTM awareness thing, or maybe trying to get doctors to take it more seriously. Anyone have any ideas? Personally i'm going to take this entire list of everyones comments to my doctor and ask them to refer me to a specialist and i am going to make someone do something about it. Let me know what you guys think? and i'll let you know how i get on (it wont be the first time i've tried ...) or probably thre last time either, as it seems they just havet bothered to do the research... but who knows!! we'll never get anywhere if we don't try..take care everyone :)",

I'm a 17yr old female and found out that my father has passed it to both my brother and I.I only really began to feel tired this year, and assumed it was due to my heavy workload (last year of school and doing a musical), however my tiredness continued on after the show. The past couple of months have probably gotten worse, all i want to do is sleep. And a visit to the doctor today (as i had a feeling i had tonsilitis) resulted in both news of tonsilitis and news that i was supposed to \"URGENTLY\" visit my doctor months ago in relation to a blood test which showed my weird iron count. When most people should be around the group of 20 to 100, mine was a \"****\" (in the words of the dr.) 6. And although my B12 levels were average (suggesting i was eating red meat etc) it was the lack of absorption that was throwing me out = thus Thalassemia.I also get cold feet constantly and he suggested that my low immune system was because of my levels.I used to constantly pass out, and have dizzy spells, and after all the CTs etc, didnt find anything...hmm, maybe if they tested my blood they may have noticed something wrong there.I also have been extremely emotional this past month, honestly just breaking down into tears for no reason, and not knowing why...to be honest as the doctor was talking to me i felt like falling apart. i didnt have a clue what was going on and all i could think \"please leave me alone, i dont want anymore problems, just give me the antibiotics for my tonsilitis and let me leave...i dont want to know about this thalassemia, pretend you never got the results!!\"however, when mum picked me up and i told her, she told me both my brother and dad had it (she was sure i knew...GOSH, i think i'd remember that!) and yeah, hence me looking up sites tonight. It kinda upsets me to know i cant donate blood, as that was something i really wanted to start when i turned 18, however its good to know why i'm feeling so tired, restless and drowsy and that its not just my imagination.",

I also have chronic depression which is horrible when you're trying to be a good mother to two little ones.\u00a0\u00a0My depression seems to\u00a0\u00a0occur more often during the winter months which may be related to the lack of sunlight during those months - I'm not really sure.My regular doctor recommended taking 1000 mcg of folic acid daily which does seem to help some with the fatigue but does nothing for the depression.I saw a few questions regarding the effect on pregnancy and I am glad to say that I was blessed with two relatively problem free pregnancies with the slight exception that my iron levels got really low (shocker) and although I had wanted to deliver my firstborn naturally I ended up having to have a C-section because I never dialated at all even after 18+ hours of labor.\u00a0\u00a0I chose to deliver my second child via C-section just because the fatigue during pregnancy after I delivered my first child was about 3x worse than normal and I wanted to get as much rest as I possibly could.I guess the one benefit I have received from this condition is that many people do seem to think that I'm about 7 or 8 years younger than I really am.\u00a0\u00a0Small consolation but it's not a bad bright side to have.I wish all of you well.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe someday there'll be an effective treatment for us.\u00a0\u00a0Until then, please keep sharing your stories.\u00a0\u00a0They have been very helpful to me just to let me know that I'm not the only one suffering out here.\u00a0\u00a0God Bless you all.",

However, thalassemia minor as a cause of leg ulcers is very rare, the first case being reported by Estes et al.[4] Thalassemia intermedica (5% of cases) is often associated with leg ulcers,[2] but not the major form.:: Case reportA 28 year old female patient came with a complaint of a leg ulcer over the left medial malleolus. which had been present intermittently since 9 months. There was no history of trauma, pedal edema, varicose veins, calf pain, or a history suggestive of collagen vascular disease.Physical examination revealed the patient to have pallor. There was a single shallow irregular shaped ulcer of 7.5 cm x 5 cm size over the left medial malleolus with a granulating floor The surrounding skin showed minimal erythema and hyperpigmentation. There were no varicose veins. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arterial pulsations were well felt. There was no splenomegaly.Laboratory data:The haemoglobin was 10 gm/100 ml with a reticulocyte count of 0.5%. The peripheral smear showed hypochromic, microcytic anemia with poikilocytes and target cells. Sickling was absent and osmotic fragility was decreased. Haemoglobin A2 was 4.5%, haemoglobin F 1.9%, Hb A 97.6% and serum iron was 55 microgram/100 ml (normal-70 microgram-200 microgram/100 ml). Total iron binding capacity was 545 microgram/100 ml (normal-250 microgram-404 microgram/100 ml) and transferrin saturation was 10.1% (normal-25%-43%). All the other investigations were within normal limits. The patient's father and elder sister showed a thalassemia trait. The other family members were not available for screening.Hospital course:The patient was admitted to the hospital and treated with systemic antibiotics for 14 days. The ulcer was treated with zinc acetate spray and aluminium hydroxide cream. Within 3 weeks, the ulcer decreased to one third its original size and had completely healed at the time of discharge, 2 weeks later.Source: http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=1989;volume=35;issue=2;spage=120;epage=1;aulast=Vagaskar",

            "answer": "Hi All,I'm 28 year old Chinese male. I've read through the forum and found that a few of the symptoms apply to me. I found out that I had BT Minor about 6 years ago when I got suspicious after feeling tired all the time even after adequate rest. In general I am a bit pale, look about 4-5 years younger than my age (Can actually be a positive side later in life), can be a bit lazy and negative because I'm feeling tired a lot of the time and have a less than perfect memory. I also suffer from dizziness even after mild exercise. However for an unknown reason my hands and feet are a not cold as many other people in this forum seem to experience. In fact they are almost always warmer than other people without BT.Anyway I just wanted to say that due to my background my mother used to take me to see the Chinese doctors for Chinese medicine. I would say that I have seen countless Chinese medicine doctors and have had my fair share of Chinese medicine. I have found that the best 'pick me up'\u00a0\u00a0medicine for me is 'American Ginseng' (Not the cheaper Korean ones because they just make your heart beat quicker and is not as effective). It is taken by grinding the ginseng into powder, mixing with hot water and drinking it (taste is not too bad as well in case your wondering). An amount equivalent to a teabag is enough for me and it makes me feel energised throughout the day. This is safe and will not negatively affect any other part of your body. One downside that it can cost quite a lot in the long run (about $10 - $15 USD per day). I am still searching and will keep you updated if I come across anything worthwhile. Also just some advice. If you are considering buying ginseng teabags off the shelf don't waste your time and money. It has NO effect. They are very bad quality and possibly mixed with other stuff).You will need to find an experienced doctor as a lot of Chinese medicine won't work because they are treating you with normal medicine which is not useful for people with BT. Most of the medicine is used to get your blood cells more active, which will work for someone without BT but honestly doesn't really make a difference for us. What you need is to increase the count of the cells (I'm still looking into that). I strongly believe that there is a cheap and effective alternative.All the best for everyone here. I will let you know as soon as I come across something worthwhile!",

For two years it has been mistaken for iron deficiency anemia. I've had the same symptoms that everyone else has described: lack of concentration, tiredness, dizziness, cold hands and feet. I also feel short of breath all the time and have gotten sick. I remember going through hell as a child in compulsory sports competitions because I couldn't run without being too short of breath and have subsequently felt very self-conscious about participation in sport, and like everyone else, have often been thought of as lazy because I cannot concentrate and am too tired to focus on tasks.Hopefully, if it turns out that BT minor is my problem, then my doctor can tell me something. He seemed really clued in to pick that up from past test results.",

            "answer": "I am Canadian male born 1953 of southern Italian descent - both sides. My mother was a carrier of BTM gene. Of 5 children 4 have BTM.\u00a0\u00a0My brother John was the only one without BTM. (He passed away in 1991 at age 43 from MS complications.)I was diagnosed with my siblings in my teens after my older sister, an RN, was surveyed for BTM gene.\u00a0\u00a0She was BTM positive and we had blood tests that proved BTM, except for John.I played sports in HS but found that I had low stamina for any cardio-vascular activity that other kids could do without any problem.\u00a0\u00a0The interesting thing was that I was lean and in good shape but I could not jog for more than 3 miles (lightly) when I was in good condition otherwise. (I would be halted by heart palpitations and heavy breathing as if I was starving for oxygen.)\u00a0\u00a0I could not learn to swim because I felt that I was grasping for oxygen after swimming\u00a0\u00a0very short distance - 20 feet - and literally having a dizzy and sinking feeling - that was scary.As I got older (I'm going on 55 now) I found that my concentration would be fragmented easily. My ability to walk up stairs is challenged -six flights of stairs and I have to stop as I start panting heavy with heart palpitations. (I am slightly above my normal weight - 5' 9\" and 175 Lbs.I also experience shortness of breath and tiredness that reduced my enthusiasm for exercise which, in turn, negatively impacts on my health. I also experience long colds and flus and fear infections as I have longer recuperation than normal folks. I also have numbness on the sides of my thighs and experienced occasional cold extremities and sensations when others do not.We share a similar problem and history. We had various advice from physicians over many years that range from denial of symptoms to serious issue. The truth lies somewhere in the middle: our stamina, alertness, suseptability to common colds/flus and mental faculties are more challenged than those without BTM.The key to quality of life is to manage our lifestyles to accommodate our special condition. Although we share BTM we experience variable degrees of similar symptoms. The differences can be a result of severity of genetic abnormality of our BTM RBCs and our ability to discipline ourselves to focus on diet, moderate exercise and adequate rest. We can also consider, especially younger members of our group, to consider career choices that do not exacerbate our symptoms - high stamina and high stress work tend to tax our concentration and increase our tiredness and induce anxiety and, in worst cases, depression.As we age we tend to be more susceptible to disease. It is not uncommon for those of us in mid-age (over 45) to start attracting more than one health condition.\u00a0\u00a0In my case, I have excess pleural in lining of my right lung.\u00a0\u00a0I also have an elongated spleen - about 2 inches (5 cm) longer than normal. My BTM makes my other organs work harder. (I also had experienced random heart palpitations that would scare me. I went for tread-mill, 24 hr. recorder, and ultrasound testing that had little results as I would show on the low side of normal and most doctors - in my experience (Canada) at least - do not get concerned about systemic health problems that fall close to normal.Our health care challenge is that doctors are trained in western traditions to treat acute and emergency issues very well but less inclined or proficient to service those of us that have lower quality of life experiences due to genetic disorders that are not\u00a0\u00a0life threatening.I controlled my symptoms by taking 1MG of Vitamin C (calcium asorbate) per day for many years. I stopped taking 1 Mg of Vitamin C per day about one year ago (2007) when I had a kidney stone that was very painful to eliminate - I went to hospital emergency for pain relief and CAT scans that found a stone passing. I resumed my 1 Mg Vitamin C today to counter my BTM symptoms as I also have an infection in my right ear that is being treated with 500mg of Amoxicillin 3 x per day -15 day treatment.I try to focus on control and management. When I am ill I reassure myself that the length of recovery is not because I have a serious illness. My recovery time is due mainly to my BTM disorder. By rationalizing health challenges as genetic we accept that our role is to manage our diet, exercise, rest, career plans and, especially, mental health to improve our quality of life with BTM.Focus on managing what you can control - diet, etc., and accept what we can not, as yet, change - BTM. Remember, we are in this together. Best wishes.Bob",

Even tho I was getting up at all hours with the new baby I felt the best I ever had. After about 4 weeks the feeling faded so I went back to the doctor who told me that having a baby creates certain hormones which is why I felt so good those 1st few weeks. To this day I beg to differ. I have since had another child & didn't have any of those energetic feelings & this time I didn't have a blood transfusion.What do you think we need then? Do you think regular blood transfusions is the answer? We need to stick together & get understood. For years I just thought I was lazy.",

I was the first member of my entire family who was diagnosed and following my diagnosis, it was found to be from my father's family who are mostly German but also some mediteranean in there as well. I had been a very skinny and sickly child but after being diagnosed, I took it on as a challenge. I started reading anything and everything having to do with health and nutrition and changed my diet to mostly organic and all unprocessed natural foods. I have always done best on a higher protein diet although I crave some carbs probably for the energy and do eat 'good' carbs and rarely the 'white flour and sugar' variety. My diet consists of lots of lean protein such as fish, chicken, buffalo, eggs, very low dairy (as I'm intolerant), lots of vegetables, fruits (mainly berries) and only sprouted grain bread occasionally as I don't do well on grains. I do have a supplement regimen and an exercise routine and have since my 20's. I believe this routine has 'saved me' although I am still always 'swimming against the current' and it is difficult to try to be normal when you're not! I can relate to the many posts here as to the fatigue, heart palpatations, etc. I will say one thing which I feel is important and that is this: Although almost every doctor of the many I've seen over these years has told me that iron supplements will not help me, that is just NOT true! I have recently been seen by a hemotologist oncologist which my women's provider sent me to for iron absorption tests because of severe iron deficiency anemia. I have always had a hemoglobin count of between 9-10 and have only ever felt great (didn't know people could feel that good) following blood transfusions given to me during pregnancies and following child birth. This doctor told my husband and I that he treats many with thal-minor and is able to treat the iron deficiency successfully although of course cannot change the way the body makes blood cells. He told us that thal-minor patients many times have problems absorbing iron and even though they may take iron pills, it does not help. Once my results were back showing I had no problem absorbing, this doctor told me to take only a liquid form of iron on an empty stomach every day as that is the best absorbed way to take iron. My woman's provider told me to get Floradix iron and herbs. I bought the yeast-free version since I have had candida yeast problems in the past, and began taking it (1/2 dose am and 1/2 dose pm) on an empty stomach. Within four weeks my hemoglobin went from 9.0 to 10.5 and I cannot believe how much better I feel....almost like a 'normal' person. I also have another liquid iron supplement made by Natrol which I had used in the past but it is not as easy on my system as the Floradix. I buy my supplements online from vitacost.com as the cost is far less than other places I have shopped. I would encourage anyone with this blood type to not give up on yourself and feel resigned to be a tired and sickly person! There is hope and with proper diet, supplements and an exercise regimen which you can tolerate, you can be the best you can be! I actually look younger and better than most my age and am in really good shape for almost 60 which I can credit to the effort of diligently working at being healthy for all these years. To those of you who don't feel you can run...try walking regularly (even if it's around the block at first). To those of you who cannot tolerate a strenuous exercise program, find one you can tolerate and stick with it. Mix up different types of exercises, like walk one day, do yoga the next and maybe light weight lifting the next. I try to do something every day and honestly do not feel good unless I do. As far as getting colds and flus constantly, I don't! This too I credit to the healthy lifestyle. Good health doesn't happen when eating a processed diet and living a sedentary lifestyle. Before my diagnosis, I ate the great American processed diet and did nothing good for myself...just the opposite...and I felt tired and sick all the time. I can honestly say that the healthier the lifestyle, the better I have felt and that I get 'punished' when I 'fall off the wagon' of my good routine. To those of you who have a low hemoglobin count and battle iron deficiency anemia, I would recommend trying the liquid irons mentioned above on an empty stomach. I honestly think you will have a good result from them if taken properly and consistently and will feel much better and have a stronger immune response as well. Good luck to you all!",

My nose sure hurt after that fall!It's meant to be gentic trait for those originating from Meditaranian countries, Mid Asia and Africa. So being Strawberry blonde, very fair with freckles and blue eyes, I was quite surprised to also have this trait.I can really understand peoples' frustration out there and I am glad there is at least this forum to get some advice. I suppose I just want to offer a huge hug to you all and try and put some of the advice into action. Even if the change is minimal, it's still a change and your quality of life can improve a little.God bless you all, and I will keep you posted to see what changes to my diet give me more energy.",

My youngest child is now 4 months and my issue is with breastfeeding. I breastfed my 4th child for 8 months, and he had many growth issues.

I am a 27 year old Australian male who was recently diagnosed with Thal minor, yet I was pretty sure I had it for years. My dad is from Cyprus so this is where I got it from. I have always been pale, had dark circles under my eyes and have constantly felt tired. I never actually got tested for it because I was always told that there are no symptoms or treatment for the condition, so I thought whats the point? I have however been told by doctors that I am Anemic, that I have irritable bal syndrome, that I am not sleeping enough etc. Now the Doctor tells me that the symptoms that I am feeling are not related to thallasemia. If this is the case then how could I have known I had it before I was even diagnosed? The symptoms are there and they are real, I am sure that there are different cases and perhaps some people are not effected as I have been. I am however angry and frustrated that our condition is not recognized by the medical community, Its kind of ironic that we are all too tired to give the condition the public recognition that it deserves lol. I hate being TIRED!!! good luck around the world.",

I have known that I have Thalassemia Trait since childhood, however I never had a doctor who knew anything about it. All my past doctors told me there are no symptoms, but this past week I went to a doctor who confirmed that the trait can cause tiredness.So, I went online (again) to try and find more information, and found this site. I, too, am extremely tired. No matter how much sleep I get, I wake up tired and feel the need to nap by 2:00 in the afternoon. It is extremely rare that I actually do nap.......which makes me irritable. I go to bed exhausted and find it hard to go to sleep. My feet, hands and nose are always cold and I am so very forgetfull. I also get out of breath with exercise. All these symptoms....and I never related them all linked to one problem.I am afraid to even talk to a doctor about being tired, because they want to label me with depression......I am not depressed...I AM TIRED. I was also diagnosed with adult Attention Deficiet Disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Now I wonder if it is the Thalassemia trait at work??I sure hope that some studies are being done. I have three daughters, two who have this same thing and I am watching as they suffer with the same problems. Now I am sure it is due to having this trait. I have recently had a hysterectomy primarily because my cycles were so overwhelmigly exhausting. I still get very tired, but not so bad as when having a period.What a relief to know that there are others and maybe some research will be started. I am bringing all this to the attention of my doctor and hopefully he can/will find more information.",

I was informed that I would bruise easier, bleed more than normal people, would have chronic fatigue, get sicker easier and for longer. That I should take a good multivitamin with iron just to make sure that I wasn't deficient in that area and they warned me to let doctors know I have this blood disorder in case they try to prescribe iron for anemia. Best info I ever received. The one paragraph literature I've seen online lists this disorder as having no symptoms, which wasn't what I was told nearly 25 years ago, and has not been my experience, though I know some people don't have symptoms. Perhaps it depends upon how anemic you are?I experienced nose bleeds one to three times per week as a child, caught every cold possible, pretty much chronically ill, dark circles under my eyes and could sleep 10 hours every night & still be tired! I would become dizzy frequently when getting up & would become fatigued much quicker than normal kids. I tend to get pretty pale looking.I still experience fatigue constantly, my MCV is 59-60, regularly, so I'm fairly anemic due to this condition.\u00a0\u00a0The only things that make me feel better is garlic and red meat such as a very good steak (I've seen some other posts saying\u00a0\u00a0the same thing) and it seems to assist for that day anyway.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps.",

My grandfathers cousin also died from Thalassemia Major because both of his parents had Minor.\u00a0\u00a0Here is some advice, make sure you have your husband/wife checked for Thal before you decide to have kids, do not want to put your kids at risk for having Major.\u00a0\u00a0 Definetly from my mediterranean Italian side of the family.\u00a0\u00a0I suffer from extreme tiredness, I can also get 12 hours of sleep and still feel like I need another 12 hours.\u00a0\u00a0I get heart palpitations time to time.\u00a0\u00a0I used to be pretty athletic, but could never run for long periods of time because of this disorder.\u00a0\u00a0I remember my coaches always yelling at me to push harder, but they just had no understanding of thalassemia, thinking I was just being a lazy person.\u00a0\u00a0I learned to deal with this since I been aware all my life, one thing that really bothers me though is the fact I cannot exercise normally, running for 5 minutes tires me out and makes my heart race.\u00a0\u00a0I know there is nothing I can do about that though.\u00a0\u00a0Relaxing walks will be the most I can do!\u00a0\u00a0I also been told by my hemotologist that iron supplements will not help in this situation unless my iron count was low, which its only my hemoglobin which is usually around 10.3 on a normal day.\u00a0\u00a0 So everyone who has thal minor feel better, because you are not alone and pretty much the worst thing you have to deal with is being fatigue 24-7 and palpitations!",

I am tired all the time, i have erractic sleep patterns, i experience symtoms of depression although i dont feel sad. When i gave birth to my first son at age 20 he was released the next day but i was held due to my iron levels. My feet are cold, im always exhausted,i get sick alot, i get severe headaches, my stomach hurts often, i bruise easeily and i am often forgetfull. Dont get me wrong i am funtional i am studying for a law degree with high marks and excersise regularly, but at the end of the day i feel as if i might die of exhaustion.Recently, for the last three months when it comes time for my period i am so exhausted i cant get out of bed. I feel dizzy and nautious. The worst part is that instead of bleeding normally like i used to for the last three months i have just spotted. No red blood, just blood clots.\u00a0\u00a0No im not pregnant my husband had a vasectomy years ago.It seems to be getting worse.I have made an appointment to see the doctor next week but im afraid he will say what i have been hearing my whole life that thalassemia minor has no symtoms.

SO TO ALL THAT HAVE BEEN TOLD THERE ARE NO SYMPTOMS-YOU ARE NOT ALONE and im glad to hear that im not either.I SAY WE BAND TOGETHER AND DEMAND RESEACH INTO THIS-SO FUTURE GENERATIONS CAN UNDERSTAND THAT ITS NOT TRUE -THEY SAY EITHER YOU HAVE MINOR WITH NO SYMTOMS OR YOU HAVE MAJOR AND ARE GOING TO DIE.

I feel so sad deep within.The only issue that matters, bothers me all the time that how will i be able to survive pregnancy or give a normal birth to a child?

In the third trimester of my pregnancy, they checked my iron levels and they turned out to be low.\u00a0\u00a0That is not uncommon, I know plenty of people to whom that has happened and they don't have B Thalassemia.\u00a0\u00a0I took some extra iron (not that much) and ate foods that contain a lot of it.\u00a0\u00a0It went up and everything went fine.\u00a0\u00a0As far as selecting a partner that doesn't have the gene, don't worry so much about it.\u00a0\u00a0This condition is not THAT common, unless you live in the Mediterranean area.\u00a0\u00a0My sister is about to get married and both have the gene.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They both live in Italy.",

It was a result from a recurring sore throat> Now I know why I keep having that infection before...we minor thalassemics have lowered immunity and we are prone to infections... Because of this my doctor kept me in constant monitoring...and since CBC is a basic procedure that's when my abnormal hgb came into notice... My medical records have shown that my hgb levels since I was like 10 years old never changed... and it's pretty abnormally low even for a child...I was reffered to a hematologist and I had undergone a series of test...including erythrophoresis I think...(i'm not so sure though) and that's the time I was officially diagnosed with Beta thalassemia minor...yeah...Just like you guys my doc also told me that I'm not supposed to be worried because it's just a minor and I will not manifest any serious symptoms but then I have always been easily fatigued and tired... and I easily be out of breathe even with just simple hiking... and my boyfriend thinks i am intensely emotional... and do have sudden mood swings...\u00a0\u00a0i do get easily depressed over things... I also have visual issues....and sometimes I even think i'm photophobic because I will have headaches if I exposed my eyes to bright lights... and about 3 yrs ago I had a renal stone... I think it was also related with thalassemia though... pls tell me if anybody else had the same occurrences as mine... and everytime I had my period... I always have the terrible cramps.... and sometimes I would even wonder if there could be any possible risk of having thalassemia major from thalassemia minor....",

            "answer": "I am a 50 year old male. It is a sad fact that the U.S. medical system refuses to study this genetic disorder further. I found this forum because I was looking for information on the trait and high altitude (over 10000 feet) because I want to visit Tibet and Peru. I have traveled extensively on 14 hour flights with cabin pressure at 10000 feet, and I have jogged in Colorado Springs and MX City (about 7000 ft) with no problems.\u00a0\u00a0There is a study I found by the Indian AF regarding fighter pilots with the trait, no problems, btw.\u00a0\u00a0I want to stay at higher altitudes - for a week - different from 14 hour flights.I became aware of my beta thal trait when I turned 18. I inherited the gene from my mother, who is Greek. I was told that there are no symptoms, however my spouse should have genetic testing done if we decide to have children. My mother (now 72) always has, and continues to suffer from so many of the symptoms described in this forum.\u00a0\u00a0She was originally told to take iron supplements, etc.\u00a0\u00a0As a child I felt lethargic, and did not want to participate in sports, activities, etc, other than riding a bicycle.\u00a0\u00a0At the age of 24, I became a Special Agent, and had annual screenings as part of the job. I therefore kept a personal record of my hbc, mch, etc. I did notice that when my HBC (hemoglobin) count was lower than 11, I would feel very lethargic. (my HBC varies from 10.4 to 12.6)At the age of 34 I noticed that I had begun to put on a little weight (I am 5'10\" and I weighed almost 180 pounds!) and did not want to look like a typical 40 year old overweight \"American\" male.\u00a0\u00a0So I began to run at least four times a week, with alternate days of anaerobic training (not too much, suits are expensive!).\u00a0\u00a0I also changed my diet, no more fried foods, lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, more fish and less meat for protein. I lost 20 pounds, and 2\" from my waist.\u00a0\u00a0( I am still there!). The exercise increased my stamina, however there are days when I listen to my body and take a break and relax.\u00a0\u00a0Stress is also a major factor, the job was stressful (more from my co-workers, however, more interested in getting promoted than catching bad guys!) and now that I am retired, I am practicing Kundalini Yoga in addition to my running, and it has incredible effects!\u00a0\u00a0 (one does not have to be a Buddhist or Hindu to enjoy the marvels of yoga and self realization). Also, you don't have to go to a club for this (it has become so trendy and this makes it lose its meaning), you can get a video, and practice this at home (try Maya Fiennes product).Anyway, the most information I have obtained on the subject is because one of three sons has Thalassemia B major (he was diagnosed before he was born - his mother is Italian with the trait - of course). With appropriate attention in Italy and in the U.S. (Johns Hopkins) he is doing well and he has given me inspiration (he receives transfusions twice a month, and daily does of chelation therapy to reduce his iron overload.\u00a0\u00a0There is so much happening now with genetics, and there is hope that once clinical trials are complete, a safer cure, other than a BMT, will be available for most of those afflicted with blood disorders.Anyway, from what I have read, there are many folks who suffer from depression, which is finally getting the attention it should, it is not related to thalassemia trait, it is a separate genetic trait, and also caused by the stress of today's society.\u00a0\u00a0A lower level of HB will cause you to feel lethargic. Stress, depression and inactivity will make you more prone to getting sick, think of each thing separately.\u00a0\u00a0However, if you decide to live a healthy and active lifestyle, it will benefit you in so many ways.\u00a0\u00a0The good news is that you cannot be afflicted by the deadliest form of Malaria (the jury is still out on this!).Oh, one last thing, do NOT take iron supplements. I alternate between taking Spirulina tablets or Ginseng, an 81 mg aspirin, glucosophamine and omega 3 fish oil.Satnam!",

When I was a child, doctors would say there was something odd about my blood, the red blood cells where extremely small not allowing an adequate amount of oxygen to travel through my blood which could cause depression, the inability to concentrateand other ADHD symptoms. When I was 18 I joined the Army and I quickly became known for passing out after a long run and after time spent out in hot temperatures (known as a hot weather causality). I've always tested anemic with any blood work sometimes more severe than others. I've read that being anemic can effect platelets , my platelets often test low and during pregnancy my platelets went dangerously low (known as ITP).I have a cocktail of blood and genetic mutations making it difficult to pinpoint the orgin of my problems or maybe it's a combination.I have Beta-thalassemia minor,I am AB positive, African-American (mixed with many races), I have red hair and freckles (a gene mutation), ITP during pregnancy (autoimmune disease), Adhd, depression, and anemia. All my life doctors have had difficulty diagnosing the issue with my blood it took them sending my blood to the University of Washington Seattle to tell me that that I had\u00a0\u00a0Beta-thalassemia minor. If\u00a0\u00a0Beta-thalassemia minor is the only blood disorder I have, I refuse to believe that there isn't any symptoms. My blood was specifically tested because there was a problem concerning my blood.",

I was diagnosed with Iron Deficiency when i was very young (about 5) and was put on iron supplements and my mom used to feed my liver daily (for the iron I suppose?). After these treatments didn't do anything it took them until I was about 9 to figure out that it was something else. I still have a thing about needles because of how many times they took my blood when I was a kid.Like everyone else I've always been told that there were no symptoms. But, I am ALWAYS tired. It's more odd for me to feel energetic than the other way around. The heat especially affects me and just wears me out. I'm pretty sensitive about being labeled as lazy so I push myself pretty hard to keep moving. But, the comments about being tired after sleeping 12 hours are no joke.I went surfing on this tonight because I saw my doctor today for a checkup on my Thyroid problems (I've been diagnosed with hashimoto's thyroiditis) and we were talking about my low HC count.Other then general diet and exercise what's the short list of do's and don't? B-vitamin supplements?Thanks for sharing, It's just good to know I'm not alone (or crazy)...",

And we have more in number/out body produces 5-6 million more RBC but smaller in size.( low oxygen carrier)Reb bloods cells are purely protein.

He doesn't experience the symptoms that many of you are talking about. He does always have cold feet and hands, I put that down to him being underweight.Something I thought I might point out, as I am a health professional , is that a lot of the symptoms you are all talking about are very common in society anyway. Fatigue, depression, a foggy mind, are very wide spread. My job is to work with people with symptoms like this and help them to upgrade their activity. For these symptoms to be linked to Beta-Thalassemia Minor, it would have to be shown that the prevalence was higher for those with BTM that the general population. I don't know the facts on this, but I'm guessing there would be no difference.However I do know that getting over symptoms such as those described above often takes a lot of hard work and a long term committment to getting better. If you have no identifiable source of the symptoms. Usually you would require a graded exercise program (daily), counselling (acceptance and committment), a consistent sleep routine, and a healthy diet.Some people with these symptoms will have a deficiency such as vitamin D, B12, iron, however it is best if you have pathology results for this before starting a supplement. Sometimes these deficiencies are linked to lifestyle factors, for example if you don't spend 15mins getting a little sunlight each day, you will be more likely to have a vitamin D deficiency. The reason you would probably not spend much time outside is that you feel tired, and so the cycle continues.I think it's worth saying that if you did an hour exercise everyday, ate no more than 2000 calories, ate 2 serves of fruit and 5 serves of vegetables everyday, slept 8hrs each night and socialised regularly and did these things consistently for a full year (without stopping because it got to hard), that I would be very suprised if your symptoms stuck around. If you are very depressed, in pain or fatigued you may also need medication with counselling to get to a point where you can commit to improving lifestyle.",

            "answer": "Hey everyone!I can't say enough how much relief I felt when I stumbled upon these site while looking for information on Beta Thalassemia Minor.\u00a0\u00a0So here's my story...When I was 18 years old I joined the Marines and this was when I really began getting regular medical checkups (because they made us) and every time I had a standard CBC drawn my H&H kept coming back low and therefore the doctors just told me I was slightly anemic and to take an iron supplement.\u00a0\u00a0No matter how much iron I took my H&H never increased to a normal range but they just kept telling me to take iron.\u00a0\u00a0I got out of the Marines at 22 and up until this point I still never really had any symptoms of anything that seemed abnormal for someone my age.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 25 years old now and approximately one year ago I began noticing some things about my health change that seemed quite odd.\u00a0\u00a0I started to notice that my feet and hands were continuously cold for no apparent reason.\u00a0\u00a0It could be 100 degrees on a summer day in August and my hands and feet would still be cold.\u00a0\u00a0I also noticed that my skin began to be clammy at times.\u00a0\u00a0I never really knew why this was going on and just kind of blew it off, but it never really stopped and still occurs to this day.\u00a0\u00a0About three months ago or so I began noticing that my heart would go into an irregular beat pattern that would last for approximately 30 minutes or so, and it would correct itself after that.\u00a0\u00a0Whenever this happens it is very uncomfortable and at times feel on the verge of passing out.\u00a0\u00a0This has happened four times over the last three months and happens \"out of the blue\" and for no apparent reason.\u00a0\u00a0The irregular heart beats were enough to get me to go see my primary doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He did an EKG and everything was normal and drew some blood.\u00a0\u00a0This is when he told me that I was slightly anemic, again!\u00a0\u00a0He also checked my iron levels which came back normal, which puzzled him for a second.\u00a0\u00a0This is when he asked me if I have heard of Thalassemia.\u00a0\u00a0I said no.\u00a0\u00a0He told me to ask my family if they have ever been diagnosed with it and so I called my dad and he said he tested positive for Beta Thalassemia Minor and so has his mother.\u00a0\u00a0I told my doctor and he drew some more blood for a hemaglobin electrophoresis test, which the results just came back and I also tested positive for BTM.\u00a0\u00a0This is when he told me that there isn't really anything I could do about it and that I shouldn't really have any symptoms from it.\u00a0\u00a0He just told me to take a multivitamin everyday.\u00a0\u00a0I thought it was weird that a blood disorder could have no symptoms so this is when I started googling BTM and this forum popped up!I find it crazy that all literature says that there aren't any symptoms for BTM but just by reading posts on this forum most of us experience the exact same symptoms and problems.\u00a0\u00a0It is comforting however knowing that I'm not going crazy and others with this disorder experience many of the same problems.Some other symptoms that I also experience or have but am not sure if they are related to BTM are: excessive stress/nervousness/anxiety, looking younger than my actual age (I'm 25 but could easily pass for 19/20), always tired no matter if I sleep 6 hours or 10 hours a night, eyes constantly feel heavy and continuous dark circles under my eyes, and my bone structure is very tiny.I hope this helps someone as much as this forum has helped relieved some of my stress about this issue.\u00a0\u00a0BTM is very real no matter how unimportant literature makes it sounds and the symptoms are even more real!Chris",

            "answer": "Hi Everyonei am now 42 and was diagnosed hypothyroid at age 15, as i was tired and tired and slow , chubby, a bit on the yellow side in palor, then i took thyroxine which boosted me at first but as life\u00a0\u00a0went on\u00a0\u00a0the tired thing was still their and the severe bloating at random started. More tiredness and odd yellow palor at times would transform me and people would wonder why i looked different some days. i had blood tests and Anemia would raise its ugly head, so they said to take iron, -didnt do a darn thing, prbably went straight to to the waste bin -loo - as i wasnt absorbing much of anything but heavily blaoted. My hair was still dry and skin rough, fatigued even on thyroid med. in my thirties i felt like i was asleep the whole time, and they thought i was depresseed. so i was taking something and i felt like an unemotional rock. that still didnt help. so i am not on antidepressant now. it was short lived. i even went gluten free which has really helped and still am.i got to my forties and still tired etc and brain fog central was more noticable as took a design course and coudnt focus much ,,it was just like being back at school again,,, and sleepy as hell even thought this was something that would make me jump out of bed in the morning, my body and brain jusy wouldnt stay ON for long. i completed the course with a struggle. If i said was exhausted people would think i was whinging or not wanting to do things, which wasnt true, so it was easier to stay quiet as no one understood me. so i would sit in agony as my brain faded and exhaustion set in. shoulda taken up acting.i then went alkaline diet for a bit -at first it is good but then i stared to fade again. Do not do this if you are Thalssemic. you will feel worse.at 41 i was working on a design set for a show and while sourcing costumes and moving things the dizziness grew like a seasick plague. and eventually couldnt get up off my feet without falling into the costume rack. I became severely bloated and yellow that day and my belly looked like i was having aliens, the stretching was painful.\\off to the hospital it was that day.Blood test was severe hypothyroid even though i was on thyroxine i was absorbig it, the Thalassemmia was the diagnosed, My mum Persian and dad Hungarian, plus mum was ALWAYS anemic as far a i can remember. That test\u00a0\u00a0was\u00a0\u00a0wher the anwser was. THEN,,, the doc asked me how i gennerally felt and it was all of the above including all the other blogs on this page.The only thing left was to\u00a0\u00a0 have a blood transfusion......i freaked out,,called my sister to come in and talk to the doctor and thought that if a diet coud fix it and it the anwer was ... NO- IT WOULD TAKE YEAAAARRRRRRS.\u00a0\u00a0So had the transfusion,i felt wierd after it but it got better and i started feel like i could breath easier, walk up a hill with no trouble, think straight, and had better sleep.( my pyschic ability was lost though) i also had a colonic - 3 sessions at a clinic, this cleared my bowel of old toxins too and any old foods. i still took iron tablets with vitamin c,a few months later i could feel i was fading again, so looked into eating more protien foods vegetable and meats. i have a pea\u00a0\u00a0 protein shake and a whey version so i alternate here and there. i eat lean steak once a week and well cooked chicken and salmon accompanied with raw salad and some cooked veggies, i have fresh lemon juice in my water for vit c and alkaline reasons, i drink water but not gallons, daily, i eat low fat cheese- houloumi is the best and yummy. i still am gluten free and stay off sugars and processed packaged foods, Also eat foods that are a precusor for your body to make Glutathione. You cant take it as your body makes it itself but some people make more than others. i reckon Thelassmics dont make much,so there you have it, thas tmy end of the stick, feels good to finally share with like minded people that have been there too.ive boosted my protein with fresh veggies, must must eat meats- thats the key but dont over do it , and remember your vitamic c so you can absorb all you viamins form fresh food.Good Luck All,Jennifer HAustralia",

            "answer": "I'm a fairly new mom my son is 9 months and was just diagnosed with Thalassemia. Right now from my under standing it's minor and we don't have to worry. The thing that does worry me is we're not sure from where in our family's this came from because as far as mine and my husbands parents know no one has ever had any form of Thalassemia ever diagnosed. My husband and I are both going to get blood tests to see if either just one of us or both of us carry the Thalassemia Minor gene. I was planning to have another child when my son was 2 but now I'm not so sure if I could handle that. I'm stressed as it is with other things but now to know my son could possibly get very sick has me even more stressed. I can say that growing up I've always had cold hands and feet like some others have mentioned. I was and still am always tired even after numerous hours of sleeping.\u00a0\u00a0I've always had a mild case of\u00a0\u00a0bi polar depression growing up but didn't find out about it until I was in my early 20's. My ethinic back ground is French, Fin and Swede. I can't say much about my husband from before we met only from that point on. He's a hard worker and as long as he has something keeping him going tiredness don't bother him. As soon as he's out of work though he's very tired and could sleep 12 plus hours if I let him. As for his temperature of his hands and feet they never get cold in fact in that aspect he's the total opposite than me his body gets warm and stays warm. In fact he has to take very hot showers where I can only take warm showers. My husband's ethnic background is French and Italian. I did a little mapping research and both France and Italy are on the Mediterranian Sea. Where as Sweden and Finland are on the Baltic Sea to the North. I'm hoping to get more answers for my situation soon because when I worry I have a hard time sleeping and then that makes things worse for me. If anyone has any information that may help me I'd be grateful if they pass it onto me. What I've found on line so far just seems to bring up more questions than getting answers.Needing friends in the same situation as me.Laura P.Massachusetts, United States",

I've known about my thalassemia since i was a kid.My main problem with the chronic fatigue is how unconcentrated i am in my life. It almost feels like im unconcious half the time.I don't know what I do right... but sometimes my energy levels spike and i can live life like i want it. Maybe it's the diet. I know for a fact that sunlight helps me a lot.The other problem is cosmetic. My face turns a yellowish colour. Usually its not enough to notice but sometimes its really bad and people comment on my paleness, that i should get some sleep etc.For me exercise and spending time in the sun keeps me energized. But still I crash and sometimes just spend days in bed, never getting up, letting my dishes build up and so on.

I've also always done better when it's nice and sunny out but didn't know i could be a symptom be cause when I was diagnosed with depression they said that it was part of the depression because sometimes the time of year and weather could affect the depression. I never had anyone ever mention paleness to me until within the last 4 years and it was more so during my pregnancy than before I was pregnant and usually when I felt weakened and tired or when I had a cold. I almost always now feel like I could just stay in bed but being a mom keeps me on the go but because of how I feel at times I have to leave my son with toys in his crib whether he likes it or not because I Start to get to weak to hold him if I don't get some sleep.Good for me to see I'm not the only person dealing with a\u00a0\u00a0lot os these symptoms.Laura P.Massachusetts, United States",

            "answer": "To All,I have thalassaemia intermediate, step up from minor and therefore I need blood transfusion from time to time. Having more severe form of thalassaemia I feel I can help you...First of all your symptoms are real. There is no such thing as any form of thalassaemia without symptoms. Take as example P. Sampras. He got thala minor and guess what? For a long time he was hiding his condition because he that he got disadvantage, especially in long torment and don\u2019t want his opponents to know about it! So you are not paranoid. But symptoms you are talking about are not all what is to it. Same are hidden and will be know in years to come. Let me tell you. Some of you already discover that you are bone structure is tiny, that you look younger. In years to come you will discover odd small abnormality in your bones, same little dents and bumps (especially on your skull) and in long run all of you will be prone to broken bones and osteoporosis. Problem with bones arise from fact and your bone marrow is in overdrive producing hemoglobin and neglect because of it production of bone cells. There is nothing what you can do about it, only try to maintain your bones. Dairy products aren\u2019t as important as magnesium is. Supplement of magnesium is THE MUST for rest of your life. Again supplement of iron will do nothing for you but folic acid is again a must. Other things I found very helpful are Butejko exercise.Butejko exercises are for asthma sufferer, but because your blood does not carry enough oxygen you will benefit from it too. Eating protein is good for your strength but do nothing for your blood. Trick for me is drinking wheatgrass. From time when I start drinking it I do increase time between transfusions from 5-6 months to about 9-10 months. Every transfusion carries some risks in it and giving you ferrin overload, this is damaging your liver and therefore you have to go thou chelating therapy and this is not a fun, less transfusions is better. What I wrote should help you to have better life. I too, found appalling that thala minor sufferer are left alone with there problems. True, thala major and intermediate are life treating conditions, but quality of life is important too.",

I found the reference to the irregular heart rate interesting as I have a pace-maker and have had AVF for most of my life. Thought to have inherited from Dad who also had AVF. After reading some of your posts here it has made me think a little more of the cause of my irregular heart rate. This condition is no joke and definitely not just in your head. I have always wanted to play golf and I do now with a lot of huffing and puffing and only 9 holes and most of the girls think it is to do with my pace-maker and its not of course. I just dont want to get into it all so I have said nothing. No one understands anyway. Except you lot.I inherited it from my mother who inherited etc etc and we have tracked it down to the Jersey Islands and my distant French relatives. I also have 2 healthy children with no BTM but had ceasarians and bed rest. And finally I try to be positive and do look younger, coming up to 60 next year and a friend asked when my 50'th was next year as we had been planning to have it in Europe next year and they were working there own holiday around it.\u00a0\u00a0All sounds a bit spooky doesnt it, maybe we are the new race.

After my doctor shot me up with iron and had me injesting it by triple the dose recommended, and it became dangerous for my baby, he finally sent a sample off to be tested for a blood disorder. Of course it came back positive for Thalassemia Minor. The scary part is that he didn't know anything about it, only that my blood doesn't carry iron because the cells are too small (that is how he described it to me). I used to try to give blood, but one woman told me I needed to go receive some. LOL.My symptoms from that time on have increased in range and intensity. I have always been anemic but am so tired some days, that I could sleep all day. I also have heart palpatations out of the blue, have experienced depression, dizziness, sore joints (getting worse), memory loss, or inability to concentrate, irritability, exessive heavy bleeding during menstruation. I actually constantly nod off while working on the computer, reading or watching tv.But through it all, I try to keep a positive perspective and humerous attitude.

So I decided to research Thallassemia since I know I have it. I am East Indian, I am not sure who I inherited the gene from because I was adopted. I was always told this blood disorder would never effect me with the exception of being anemic. But reading through these posts I have experienced all of these symptoms at some point. I have had heart palpitations and doctors could not figure out was caused them, and I was told I had inappropriate sinus tachycardia. So I was put on heart medicine. I no longer am on medication, but still experience heart palpitations. I believe I go through bouts of very mild depression, I am always tired, and even after getting \"adequate\" rest I could still sleep for another 8 hours easy! It is funny to read how people have talked about being small in bone structure, and looking\u00a0\u00a0younger than they are. I am 22 and only 5 foot, I have a petite bone structure (may have to do with being Indian as well).

What else can I do to treat my Thallassemia? I am married and am planning to have children (sometime in the future) and I am afraid Thallassemia will cause complications, can anyone help shed some light on that? Thank you!",

            "answer": "Must agree with comment above! My doctors' lack of knowledge (In England) of Thal Minor has lead me to think I was suffering from emotional problems when in fact these were symptoms that could posssibly be attributed to T-.I would also have night terrors for no reason, and wake up each morning my body complete wracked with anxiety due to my lack of aerobic movement/low oxygen supplies during the night. In addition to my poor concentration, anxiety if I'm not in motion, and my tendancy to drift quietly to sleep if my work is not engaging/active it's been hard to prove that I'm not work shy or lazy. I cannot watch TV, travel in a car (seated) for long periods of time without feeling miserable, agitated anxious and tired. I literally have to pace up and down the living room if I'm with my family so that I can stay 'up' and sociable. I take folic acid, but to be quite honest the best I've ever felt was when I was poorly enough to qualify for a blood transfusion. I have never had warm hands before in my life. I actually felt AWAKE, could concentrate for more than 1 minute without drifting off during conversations and even my tutors at uni noticed a difference. That's when I got an inkling that my natural low mood was related to my Thal and not to the stresses and strains of life. I am tired of sitting in this sleepy fog all the time, watching other people hold conversations or enjoying life. I am glad that this site is here and hope other Thal Minors will find it so they too can also share more of their Asymptomatic Symptoms.",

My blood has been tested over and over for many years and everytime i was diagnosed anemic. Iron supplements wouldn't help, they still don't. Every doctor I have discussed my Thalassemia with has told me numerous times that there's no symptoms to Thalassemia...Well it's nice to finally see that I'm not the only one believing that there are symptoms in those who have Thalassemia Minor (Beta). I also feel the HEART PALPITATIONS, the TIREDNESS, the DIZZINESS and alot of easy BRUISING. My body gets so week that it starts to tingle and my vision gets blurry and I can't hear anything. I have to sit a few minutes to catch my head or I will faint. I have been battling MILD DEPRESSION on and off, I'm forgetful cause I CAN'T FOCUS on anything. Omg...and pms Makes all my symptoms worse. Why do doctors not listen to us when we tell them whats wrong? They write us off as either anemic or hypochandriacs.

We have hemolytic anemia which means our red blood cells break down at a faster rate. One of the by products of this break down is bilirubin, it is yellow in colour and responsible for jaundice.Now, with hemolytic anemia the bilirubin levels are always slightly elevated. To get rid of it you need the sun. When bilirubin reacts to sunlight the entire structure of it changes and it becomes much more water soluble making it easier for the body to metabolise it.Also, look into gluceronic acid. It makes molecules water soluble in the body. Bilirubin can be conjugated with gluceronic acid.",

I am an 18year old female and a freshman in college, I ran track all through middle school and high school (a sprinter of course, distance has always been a struggle). I was always out of breath right from the beginning of practice,almost like i had asthma, but that never means you should stop because you get tired quickly. running sprints and then walking for short distances in between is a good way to keep going.also eating smaller amounts more often helps. my family has found that when any of us are hungry we become extremely irritable until we eat something. being hungry also contributes to dizziness. i had a few fainting spells after morning track practice because i didnt have time to eat breakfast.i believe most of us are just tired all of the time because of our lifestyles maybe. I'm a college student of course i'm tired! i stay up late all the time to do homework. most people that i know are tired all of the time. exercise and maybe a nap here and there will help a TON!I also would like to advise most people with this blood condition NOT to take iron, unless you have some other condition that causes iron deficiency. thalassemia does not cause iron deficiency, therefore, taking iron may cause your iron levels to become too high. thalassemia is often times misdiagnosed as anemia.I do have Thalassemia like all of you and I am glad that i found this because it is nice to know that others are experiencing what I am.\u00a0\u00a0I never make excuses for myself because i have this disorder though,\u00a0\u00a0thalassemia minor is not life-threatening\u00a0\u00a0so it wont hurt me to run a little further. i am currently working up to running a half marathon. it might be fun... we'll see. so far i've been running up to 3.4 miles, got a ways to go still. wish\u00a0\u00a0me luck!thanks for reading!P.s. stay in shape.",

I push myself soo hard trying to convince myself that there is nothing wrong with me. However\u00a0\u00a0my determination usually leaves me immune-suprressed and with an illness! I also catch every cold, virus, and have had some serious illnessess (meningitis) in the past. Usually when doctors see my labs they will comment on the fact that I am anemic, but once I make them aware of my thalassemia they say, \"oh that explains it\" and thats It! I say, \"I know it explains it but the problem is doc I am still feeling very fatiqued and have shortness of breath with other sypmtoms.\". It seems that they just totally dismiss my symptoms once they know I have it. I really really wish more research was done about this.

            "answer": "My paternal grandmother found a doctor that specialized in the thalasemias decades ago. He had a theory that since the spleen cleans your blood, it was probably taking out the deformed blood cells. She had BTM and agreed to be his guinea pig for a spleenectomy to see if it would improve her energy levels. After that operation, she was UNSTOPPABLE.I have BTM as well and suffer from fatigue, depression, brain fogginess, dizziness, high bilirubin levels, etc., but every doctor and specialist I've spoken to says that BTM has no symptoms and I should get on depression meds. (I've tried and they don't help.) They also say that a spleenectomy won't do anything for it. The last hemotologist I spoke (argued) with said: \"I went to medical school. I should know!\"I'm currently 8 months pregnant with my 2nd. My pregnancies have been fairly uneventful except I'm more tired than usual. The worst thing I experienced from having a baby was the recovery. It took me about two years to start feeling like my usual (although tired) self. During that first year after giving birth, my blood \"hurt.\" I don't know how else to describe it. I was beyond fatigued, I developed phobias (which cleared up when my blood got better), I had post partum depression, I couldn't drive for the first few months because I was so dizzy and paranoid. I wanted to nurse but I couldn't produce any milk. (My doctor said the anemia had nothing to do with it). I should have gotten a blood transfusion. (My hematocrit levels were 22.) Hopefully things go better this time around.Anyway, good luck everyone. The only advice the hemotologist could give was \"Move to sea level... Mediteranean style.\" (I paid $127--after insurance--for that advice.)",

            "answer": "I am a 40 year old Jamaican, of chinese decent born with the the Alpha Thalessmia trait.For most of my life I my iron deficiency was misdiagnosed as anemia.Now - I am told as all of us are - that there are no symptoms & no follow-up medical care necessary for the Trait.So having found this blog I am so relieved and happy b/cz my life experiences are the same and I thought I was just sick or something.My health statistics are :I have O, RH negative Blood.Haemaglobin is about 9 all the time.Permanent low blood pressure - 110/70 or thereabouts and when I get the dizzy spells from stress or oevrwork - it drops to 90/50 - all the time.I've been told by my Haematologist that - I have Alpha Thalessemia Trait, ovol & tear dropped shaped blood cells. TMy HB is a steady state of 9,so the red blood cells therefore carry less oxygen than a normal person. To compensate, the heart beats faster.Therefore - my heart has a murmur - b/cz it has to beat twice as hard.The heart beating faster results in a High metabolic rate (so with good results -\u00a0\u00a0I'm naturally slender no matter how much I eat).Alpha Thalessmia trait resulting effects\\symptoms on me, I think are:- I get dizzy if I move from horizontal to vertical position too quickly.- Crave beef & salty cheese very often- Susceptible to the flu & most airborne diseases-\u00a0\u00a0Normally cold in the evenings.Wear sweater or overshirt.-\u00a0\u00a0Tire easily after work out-\u00a0\u00a0Extreme debilitating dizziness - if I push my work load too much .- I've been taken off iron since diagnosed in 2003. But I have high Ferritin stores - like over 1,000 PMOL/L (which concerns me)- Fatigue is a result of the blood disorder due to less oxygen.TREND:Over the last 7 years - I've had repeat episodes of severe, debilitating dizziness, warranting 1 week bed rest each time. It seems\u00a0\u00a0that its linked to this blood disorder. Typically- when I'm pressed at work, I drink less - so my pressure drops. Then the lack of oxygen from the thalessemia trait causes the dizzines to be magnified. I mean I cannot stand very well!I also get very fatigued after sustained pressure from office. Dr.'s tell me-stress decreases red blood cells and causes it to not function properly.No that I know what I have and the dizzy drama effects:I take care of myself . I take vitamin C - and so I get sick less often.I walk uphill - twice per week now. I'm no longer out of breath and fatigured.I take Vitamin B Complex with Folic in the mix. I am now full of vigour and I try to manage my stress at office, drinking water regularly throughout the day and eating balanced meals.I eat beef and salty cheese whenever my body demands it to prevent getting sick (If the craving is ignored i get dreadly dizzy & sick).Hope that helps.

            "answer": "Hi all,I'm excited to read your posts. I was diagnosed with BTM when I was 24. I never had much strength, and was terrible at physical endurance tests when young. That said, I have *a lot* of energy: I'm just really bad at running and playing sports . . . and I always thought it was just because I was unathletic . . . but now I see a connection between having BTM and my inability to participate in athletic activities. Like others, I look much younger than my age. I am 40, and most people think I'm in my 20's. I also tend to stay up really late, and sleep in. I tend to be manic or really tired.I don't have palpitations or any of that other stuff-- just found out I have high blood pressure (runs in the family)-- when I was pregnant (my baby is fourteen months old now) I literally slept ALL THE TIME: all day, all night. (That is normal, I think.) But I wonder if I was so sleepy because of BTM. My daughter was born 7 weeks early. I don't know yet if she has BTM. I am inclined to think she doesn't. She has a lot of energy. Is very strong. Though she is PALE, like me. I am very very PALE.As someone else posted, I was surprised to learn I had \"mediterranean blood disorder,\" as I knew myself to be descended from Northern Europeans (I'm a USA mongrel) . . . there were no Italians or Greeks to speak of in my lineage. (My mother is from Western PA, and she and her family have the trait as well.)\u00a0\u00a0It's funny. The doctors always ask me what my heritage is when they discuss BTM with me. The thing is, how can I know? I have a blood disorder that is Italian/Greek, but I am neither of those. I suspect someone in the past few generations of my family hooked up with an Italian or a Greek. And that no one in my family knows this-- like I said, I'm a mongrel, so many different \"countries\" are in my blood, it's hard to keep track.I had a child using a sperm donor and made sure to pick someone who did not have BTM.I also have cold feet and hands, and feel cold all the time. I just found out I have a $800 heating bill today. Now, that's a \"side effect\" of this disorder, no?It's very interesting to know that others have these same issues: fatigue, insomnia, weird sleep patterns, look younger than their age.I'm going to start taking prenatal vitamins again-- that's what a doctor had me do years ago. The folic acid, etc., will help. I've been taking iron lately, because my iron was really low when I was about to have my baby, but now I think my obgyn was misreading the blood tests, and the low iron was more likely my BTM.Best wishes to all!!Cate",

As a child I had really bad stomach pains, was tired and cold all the time, and was very gassy. Now I am 25 yrs old, I have changed my diet and exercise regularly. I eat foods that are high in Vitamin B12 (lots of broccoli) and try my best to eat foods that are low in acid.

I no longer have stomach pains, I am not as gassy, and I am not tired all the time. In fact I have a lot more energy than before. I think this is one of those traits that we can control by our chosen lifestyles (thank God). The hardest thing is developing these good habits.

            "answer": "Hey guys, I'm a medical student, and I too have b-thal minor (trait).\u00a0\u00a0I actually found out via a random cbc a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0Some of the symptoms you guys describe on here can't possibly be from b-thal minor.\u00a0\u00a0This condition affects nothing more than your rbc's, and it's very possible that you may have something else going on that you should be checked out for. This disease will not make you more prone to becoming sick and catching the cold (this would most likely involve a wbc, or nutrient abnormality), cause seizures (which can be from a number of things, like electrolyte imbalance, trauma, etc., but not rbc dysfunction), or celiac's disease (which is autoimmune and has nothing to do with your rbc's).However, cold hands and feet, tiredness, slight trouble breathing, and minor exercise intolerance can all be attributable to b-thal minor due to the slight microcytic anemia it causes.\u00a0\u00a0If you have a hemoglobin concentration below 8, then there is something else going on (you could have iron deficiency on top of b-thal minor, but usually b-thal minor patients have relatively normal, to slightly decreased levels- usually not lower than 10). It's important to realize that just because we all have b-thal minor does not mean we all have the same degree of the condition.\u00a0\u00a0Many mutations have been demonstrated in the genes coding for beta hemoglobin, and while some may have more severe forms (with possible deletion of the beta chain), others may have forms of lesser severity.\u00a0\u00a0However, b-thal minor is defined as only having 1 genomic copy of an abnormal beta chain, as 2 (one from your mother and the other from your father) can be interpreted as B-thal intermedia or major depending on the mutations present.That being said, even the most severe forms of b-thal minor leave us with 1 perfectly good copy of the beta chain, so never should this condition become totally catastrophic and crippling, as some of you seem to fear.\u00a0\u00a0I personally have constant cold hands and feet, but there is nothing major to worry about with b-thal minor.\u00a0\u00a0It does not weaken your immune system, cause autoimmune disorders, seizures, stomach pains etc.\u00a0\u00a0If you are experiencing symptoms other than mild fatigue, cold hands and feet, and mild grogginess (all of which can be attributable to severe forms of b-thal minor), then there may be some other condition going on that you should have checked out.If you plan on having kids, it's also important to have your partner get a hemoglobin electrophoresis to assess if he/she also has the trait.\u00a0\u00a0If both of you have it, then there is a 25% you kids will be normal, a 50% chance they will have b-thal minor (like yourself), and a 25% chance that they could have b-thal major- which is really bad and requires lifelong blood transfusions, possible bone marrow transplant, and a vastly shortened life expectancy.\u00a0\u00a0So, it's definitely important to have your partner checked out before having kids.Hope this was informative :) I wanted to just to relax your nerves a bit, as this is really nothing to be overly concerned with, save the small possibility of mild fatigue, and symptoms I discussed.\u00a0\u00a0And as a small plus, if you're an African traveler and develop malaria, you will suffer a lesser degree of complications because all forms of malaria require a normal functioning b-chain.\u00a0\u00a0This is not to say you cannot get malaria (you can, since you still have 1 good b-chain gene), but that if you do get it, it probably wouldn't kill you (likewise for sickle cell).\u00a0\u00a0Also, a few studies have suggested that the smaller size of our rbc's (microcytic anemia) put us at a decreased risk for stroke and heart disease since they're less likely to get \"hung-up\" and \"tangled up\" in blood vessels, but again this is not to say you are immune to dying from a stroke or heart disease, just that you may have a slight reduced risk :).",

            "answer": "Hi fellow BTM,I was researchig on whether with BTM it will be more susceptible to mountain sickness. (please let me know if anyone knows. ) and then i came across all these discussions about BTM, Relieve in some ways that all my symptoms is very much all related to one thing and its not in my head.I never had associated certain symptoms that i have with BTM as we all know why. Even though a few chinese doctors Ive seen have drawn this association.In chinese medicine they talk of chi (energy) and blood. I have been told i dont have enough of this. My lips have a dark rim and not very rouge, a sign of poor blood circulation and lack of blood.\u00a0\u00a0 the chinese doc talks of stagnant chi which is not good and causes tiredness and can lead to depression....which i find when i havent done much exercise, i feel even more tired.i find that not over exerting myself with regular gentle exercise keeps me more energetic. Also, by tapping on your centre of chest, helps move stuck enegry and helps when you feel depressed.you need to tap hard enough but not hurt that feels comfortable.for me 9 hours is optimal sleep, if i sleep more, which i sometimes do, coz i feel so tired, but have found thats related to sleeping so long the body is hungry, but because i'm so sleepy i ignore it. so when i do get up i feel very weak from hunger and groggy from too much sleep.i also get palpitations and together with naseau, dizzyness and sudden coldness, feelslike i about to break into cold sweat usually when i havent rested enough and feeling very tired, (but not every time i'm really tired), closeing my eyes and calming my thoughts help, but it will get to a point i have to lie down, relax, shut eyes and dettach from any thoughts. Even a nap, helps so much, but usually i just fall asleep. then next day i feel close to normal. Guess i hardly feel completely energetic.Needless to say with periods, before during and after (yeah so it's like for 3 weeks in a month) it's much worse. I also have mood swings but maybe that's just pms. I've also always had irregular periods until i took the pill which helped alot with the anemic smyptoms and other pms symptoms.(common ones as well as really bad digestion that leads to throwing up and stomache pain) I wonder do female BTM tend to have this problem?I feel like my body is extra sensitive, i need to take extra care with it and it'll feel better almost immediately and when i dont take that extra bit of care i feel the consequence very quickly.\u00a0\u00a0My friend who's a doctor has always said that it seems like i have to be so finely balanced to feel well, anything slight can knock me into a frenzy of ailments and symptoms.and so my symptoms are not constant and depends on how i treat myself. SO for those of you that feel constant symptoms, perhaps trying out a\u00a0\u00a0change in lifestyle habit could help.I was also diagnosed with reactive\u00a0\u00a0hypoglycemic...(which if i didnt read in this forum perhaps in another,)\u00a0\u00a0that it seems to have some correlation.I do hope to have children one day, and reading earlier posts is scaring me somewhat. Have any BTM had no complications and relativity\u00a0\u00a0ok pregnancy and child birth?BTW I found the following forum to be quite useful.http://www.thalforum.ca/forums/thalassemia-minor/205-start-here-testing-diet-thalassemia-minor.html",

Inherited from my dad who is Chinese-Italian. Never played any sports until I took up tennis at 40. Always had cold hands and nose but never really bothered me. I feel fatigued if less than 7 hours of sleep. Symptoms have never really bothered me until the last few years. I get winded easily and can not run any distance. On top of it all, I have asthma. But now that I think about it the asthma may be the Thalassemia. I said I play tennis, only doubles. I play 4-5 times a week. One of the most helpful things I found is to take a good B-Complex vitamin every day. I take 2 tablets and feel the energy kick in. Lots of cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, onions are also good for your health. Foggy mind, blurry vision and headaches...... I thought it might be premenopausal, but could be Thalassemia. I go away to the mountains for the summer because it is so much cooler. Altitude is only 5k feet but walking any distance is a strain.\u00a0\u00a0 So happy to know that others share similar symptoms. They are not hopeless. Staying active and being around others seems to really help emotionally.",

Im a 31 yr old female, i have suffered from migrain headaches, blurred vision, constantly cold hands and feet and of course excessive tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0I find that the only thing that warms me up and makes me feel good is aerobic exercise and I have to take diet pills to get the energy to do it. I cant run because my hands and feet swell up so I have to use the elliptical. But it does help. I also try to foods with alot of iron because I heard the supplements dont get digested. My newest symptoms (not very new, its been ongoing for about a year) is a dull aching pain in my left upper abdomen. Does anyone else have this symptom?

My parents were both tested after me, as we had to link where it came from and it was my fathers side of the family.. He lived a perfectly normal life and didnt know he had any thing wronge untill he was diagnosed. However he did say that he was always tired but didnt think any thing more of it.. Mum told me that when i was a baby/toddler i always slept alot and if i got sick with the common cold it always hit me very hard, i catch colds very easily and get purple shading under my eyes when really tired, it isnt as obvious the older i get, im fairly pale and its always an issue when i need to have bloods taken as my veins dont like to part with my blood or the vein disapears! The biggest thing is IM SO TIRED!! 24/7 im tired, i can sleep 12 hours and wake up tired, i can sleep 4 hours and wake up tired! it *****! Driving is the killer, get me in that car and im almost falling asleep at the wheel and that fatigued i hardly realize its happening, my memory is shocking and ive noticed its way worse when i dont get proper sleep, i have to push my self to do every thing in my life, if i didnt i would lay on the couch and sleep all day! Gym is good for me i think the hardest part is getting there, once i do get there im ok although i do experience shortness of breath and heart palpitations from time to time, even when not excercising. I am the coldest girl in the world... at least i thought i was untill entering this forum!! its great to see that there are more ppl just like me and that im not alone in this big world... I dont even tell ppl i have this as no ones ever heard of it, and i feel like ppl will think im complaining or making up excuses, no one understands the restraint this condition can put on you when your trying to keep up with every one else around you! Some times i get that delusional i walk around my house wondering what im meant to be doing... my hands and feet get soooo cold and my partner often comments that he didnt think it was possible for some one to be that ice cold unless they were dead! i can be in a warm room and still they are like ice blocks! I have 2 beautiful kids and my first pregnancy was really long and lazy, had iron injections every second day for the last month, although my daughter hasnt been tested im 85% sure she has it, my second pregnancy was great i had normal energy but got really faint very often and needed to sit down, after labour i hemoriged and needed 3 units of blood afterwards, i looked like a white peice of paper, i had no color left in me at all, my second child has soooo much energy compared to my first child, he runs me off my feet and i just cant keep up with him at the best of times, i dont think he has it.. my daughters always moody and doesnt like doing any thing that takes to much effort.. she is alot like me although i push myself to do the things i need to and she doesnt! I think that all theses storys have a link and i to have depressional states, depending on my sleep and personal stresses in life. Ive just learnt to slow down and dont take on every thing and make sure you give yourself the sleep that your body needs.. thanks for all the helpfull comments on here and keep them comming ppl!!! all the best",

As far as i can remember, i have felt tired and exhausted, even getting up late in the morning. i am 37 years old and a mother of 3 sons. my first pregnancy went through normal, but after haveing first baby it took 7 years to conceive again, and in\u00a0\u00a08th month, a routine check up revealed that i had developed preeclamsia, my blood pressure was high enough to kill me and my baby, so the doc had to induce pains and deliver the baby prematurely. i got pregnant after 2 1/2 years and this time right from the begining the doc was concerned to keep a check on my blood pressure, which due to medication remained normal but i got breathing problem and was got so breathless day by day that walking to the bathroom made me panting and feeling dizzy, so i was forced to go on complete bedrest, and in the end as my baby was not getting enough oxygen, i had to have a c-section. during my pregnancies i also got to know that i couldn't tolerate\u00a0\u00a0iron supplements which made me feel dizzy, a feeling of heart sinkness and also occasional palpitation. my doc was wondering why i had all these problems, but never discovered that i had the thalassaemia trait. until recently i had to to through blood screenign recommended by a orthopedic surgeon, who was treating my severe back ache from which i have been suffering for the last decade. that doc suspected that i might be carrying the trait in my blood and suggested further blood tested which proved his suspecion. i was relieved to know that my problem has been diagosed and now i will be able to get rid of my muscular spasm, pain and exercion which has made my life so miserable to the extent that i can not work properly unless and until i get my power sleep. but got disappointed\u00a0\u00a0when the doctors said that i am a normal person as thalassaemia minors donot have any symptoms and donot need any therapy. doing mild exercise and physiotherapy will help me out of my fatigue. but it has n't. walking makes my feet to swell up. i wake up with my arm and fingers numbed, get so much dizzzy some time and feel that my brain has got deprived of oxygen. so i decided to do my own research and got to go through this forum. I am happy to got to know tha i m not alone and all my symptoms are a due to thalassaemia trait. i don't know whether mine is of alpha type or the beta type. but its really frustrating to know that there is no therapy available for us people. I feel there should be more studies carried on thalassaemia minor patients so doctors can stop themselves that thalassaemia minors don't have symptoms",

I have always known that I have BTM, I was tested as a child because a cousin of mine died from Cooley's anemia many many years before I was even born, but other than MD's telling me that I am anemic I have never looked into it. At 40 years old, I am just now having a full hematologic lab workup done and I am meeting with the MD on Friday, I just had the labs sent to me and I am reading them as I am writing this. I am not sure the hematologist belived me but of course the labs came back from Mayo as positive for BTH. I want to demand treatment, all of my labs are off. My Ferritin level is a 17, and as an athlete that is a big problem, Should we only treat people with an actual level of 12, come on! I hear the same thing, \"he probably will not treat you b/c your not bad enough\". I want to demand treatment. I am a very physically active person who is seemingly healthy but like all of you I am tired, groggy, have had mild points of depression (never treated), have trouble waking up, shortness of breath, extremely sore muscles, dry skin, cold hands and feet and I live at an elevation of 7500' which doesn't help. I am very healthy so I do not need to change lifestyle and I am a credentialed nutrition professional. I do eat a mainly vegetarian diet b/c that is what I prefer but my levels are the same as when I ate meat as an adolescent. I take a very good MVI with Fe and often a prenatal, I have found and now carry a great isotonic version in my office, my Hgb levels went from 11 to a 12.5, the highest in my lifetime, so of course the MD thinks I am \"not bad enough\" for concern. I am dizzy very often, and my skin is just dull I think and when I run I just watch people pass me on the uphills because I have no O2 getting to my muscles. I cannot concentrate and I was thought of as a unmotivated student but in reality when I was in high school I just could not concentrate. This SEVERELY affected me in school when I was younger, sometimes in college and high school I would get so fatigued I would almost pass out in class, but b/c I look normal and healthy, no one has helped me, and I am in the health care field. Has anyone had any luck asking or demanding a MD for an infusion?Thank you for all of your posts!!!!",

            "answer": "HI all!I am 24 yr old female.\u00a0\u00a0I suffer from Thalassemia which comes from my mothers very british paternal side.\u00a0\u00a0My mother, grandfather, and other distant relatives suffer from this disease but for the most part it seems that I have developed more and more severe symptoms than any of them!\u00a0\u00a0Forever everyone has always thought that I have just been a lazy hypochondriac.\u00a0\u00a0I have seen doctor after doctor, specialist after specialist for all these problems I have had because everyone has always said that Thalassemia is asymptomatic, and since my family members don't experince the same problems I thought I just had a lot of different unrelated problems.\u00a0\u00a0Now I really think it is all related to Thalassemia which I have always suspected.I have always been extremely tired, lethargic, and have zero motivation.\u00a0\u00a0I need at least ten hours of sleep a night or else I am in a fog all day, can barely keep my eyes open and require a nap at some point in the day.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone else have excessive vivid dreaming?\u00a0\u00a0I have been seeing a sleep specialist lately who has not been able to figure out why I am so tired all the time since I tested free of apnea and narcolepsy.Whenever I am examined by a doctor they can only tell me I am perfectly healthy and the only things to work on is my iron, vit a,c, and d levels.\u00a0\u00a0For those of you looking for some sort of iron supplements I would say NO or at least find a great Hemotologist who has knowledge of this problemto give you proper advice.\u00a0\u00a0Our blood is misshapen and to the body looks unhealthy.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, the spleen tends to recycle a lot more blood then \"normal\" people's do, which means you can easily have a buildup of minerals, including iron which can be toxic.\u00a0\u00a0My great uncle nearly died of this after receiving a blood transfusion with iron supplemation after a car accident.\u00a0\u00a0I tend to get \"spleen cramps\" and some Thalassemia suffers opt to get their spleen removed because it is so overactive.\u00a0\u00a0Someone also asked if there is a relation to Thalassemia and Leukemia, and the answer is no, although back in the day they believed it to be true.\u00a0\u00a0My grandfather was not allowed to fight in WWII because the doctors believed he would develop Leukemia since he had Thalassemia, but again, it is just our misformed blood.Not only do I suffer from fatigue but I also am easily out of breath.\u00a0\u00a0The worst when I partake in cardio exercise, which has always been embarassing in gym class and have not been accepted onto any sports team because of it.\u00a0\u00a0I just look lazy and out of shape when really our blood does not absorb oxygen and glucose properly.\u00a0\u00a0This is why we get out of breath easily and why our muslces cramp and fatigue easily.\u00a0\u00a0I also have symptoms similar to hypoglycemia, and if I don't eat regularly I feel sick and faint.\u00a0\u00a0I do have fainting spells, usually if I feel over-heated or if I stand too long, although a lot of the times it seems random.\u00a0\u00a0I am both heat and cold sensitive; in the summer I tend to become dehydrated and sun sick easily, and in the winter no amount of layers of clothes can keep me warm, my hands and keep are ice cold to the touch and within.I suffer from depression, anxiety, panic disorder, ocd, and insomnia.\u00a0\u00a0There is a long line of mental illness in my family but it tends to be just one disease per person, and I seem to have every disease that has ever existed in my family.\u00a0\u00a0I'm wondering if maybe I have just underlying depression that is worsened by the thalassemia.\u00a0\u00a0I have probably tried about 8 different medications for these problems but nothing seems to work completely.\u00a0\u00a0It is VERY interesting to me that most of you suffer from some form of depression.I also have had heart palpatations but it has been so rare I never thought twice about it.\u00a0\u00a0It happens 99% of the time after I have a long hot shower;\u00a0\u00a0I feel overheated, get the feeling like im going to pass out ( I call it fade to black because My vision slowly-well, fades to black) and when I lay down to avoid passing out My heart beats rapidly, then stops beating for a sec, and rapid again.\u00a0\u00a0This only happens a couple times a year so I figured... whatever.I feel like I could go on forever with my symptoms, but long story short I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who has suspected that this \"asymptomatic\" disease does in fact carry many many problems.\u00a0\u00a0It definately varies from person to person so it is possible that we are definately the minority which is why it hasnt really been looked into.\u00a0\u00a0I know that my mother and grandfather have minimal symptoms if any, thew only thing my mother has had a problem with is the breathing.I already had a dr appt set for monday for something else, but I think I'm going to print this out and show them I'm not crazy!! haha!best wishes to all of you!\u00a0\u00a0There is no cure, and everyone feels different with this disease, so my best advice is to monitor yourself closely to figure out what is best for you in connection with exercise, diet, etc.\u00a0\u00a0(I personally take long walks for cardio and strength training has always kept me fit and trim.\u00a0\u00a0I also eat very healthy and feel sick when I eat over-processed foods.\u00a0\u00a0Just sayin')\u00a0\u00a0I still feel like sh*t every day, but I know it is an ongoing process.Thank you to all of you for posting your experiences!!!!!!",

I went to the GP, and he basically said that people who have Thalassemia don't really know they have it, which sounded absurd, meanwhile another GP has been telling me for years to take iron supplements, which can be harmful for people with the condition. I was told by really good nurse that whilst there is no cure, what i can do is take Folic acid and Vitamin E supplements. I wish there was more i could do or more practical day to day advice as not much seems to really help.",

Sorry for my bad english....I am living in Belgium.I have Beta-thalassemia minor with symptoms!!!!\u00a0\u00a0So am I very interesting by this post.Most doctors, association of Thalassemia and people that have thalassemia major in Belgium, think that there are no symptoms with minor form. That's a real war!!!\u00a0\u00a0I feel that very sad....But there is also people who agree with me I have just created a new blog about mimor form and symptoms.Go to and visit my blog\u00a0\u00a0at the following adresshttp://thalassemie.over-blog.net/For the moment the blog is only in french but you can probably translate it with a web translator.I'll try to translate very soon!Il tell in my blog my life with beta-thalassemia minor\u00a0\u00a0and try to give counsels to help.

Since about the age of 12, it has gotten progressively worse, with headaches going stronger, I occasionally faint and I lack the energy to do many of my daily tasks without getting mild anxiety from fatigue. I was diagnosed around at the age of 8, but was told there were some mild symptoms that would go away as I grew older. (this was obviously wrong, as I now am in dire need of iron and my blood pressure is dangerously low). When my real problems began (when I started fainting and lacked the energy to go to school), I was put into the hospital to check me for diseases, but nothing came up. Interestingly, I'm not too bad at sports once I get in shape, but this does absolutely nothing to my general tiredness. It seems cardio and anemia aren't very related.I just want my doctor to recognize my disease (I live in Britain) so I can get rid of this while I'm still young to avoid problems later in life.damn genetics, how do they work?",

            "answer": "Yes I found out I had Thalassemia after my first pregnancymy hemoglobin levels were sooo dangerously low they had me on double prenatal vitamins and monitored my blood count every 2 weeks and that was when I ate meat. Now I am a vegetarian.My daughter was born\u00a0\u00a0with fetal hemoglobin, her iron levels were so low she turned yellow from lack of iron or something. After this the doctors sent me for the test and I found out I had Beta Thalassemia at the age of 25. I am now 53 and well my mother thought I was the laziest teenager on earth I slept so much.If I overwork and do not get enough rest it is horrible, the level of exhaustion. My son 17 has Thalassemia and he sleeps forever. My father always slept a lot on the couch finally at the age of 70 I asked his wife to take him for the test and yes he has it too.We are of Hungarian origin.I feel better if I have had a lot of sleep and especially if I can get a nap in each day. Overworking is bad, the levels of tiredness can be overwhelming.I have for 25 years taken a vitamin supplement non synthetic is best. I take a multivitamin, Calcium, C and D (d being very important in the winter 1000 mg per 25 pounds of body weight I take 50000 units daily)I also take Sun Chlorella, these give me a great boost. I am a vegetarian and and notice I need protein every day but feel better if I have as much raw food or cooked vegetables. Live food.Sugar is a disaster best to avoid in daily diet, and processed food diets are not good either. I have had migraines with the white flashes of light too and I have scoliosis and so does my son. Exercise is a must to keep levels up but when I feel really tired nothing but rest and sleep help. I have a friend who is a doctor with Thalassemia, we both agree we need sleep, more than anything else.Pacing myself is important, not to overdo things, as long as I have 2 days off of rest I manage and of course taking my vitamins and excercising",

I have been told by Doctors my whole life that I would not experience any symptoms from BTM. Well I have the same symptoms as many people on this post, so the Doctors were clearly wrong.What I'm interested in is finding out how to best live with this condition and have a normal productive life, and to be able to enjoy working out and keeping fit. Because it is much harder to exercise and keep fit with BTM.I will post some of the things that I have learned about myself through trial and error when I have more time, and I would appreciate it if any other that know about proper diet and nutrition would add to this post. We need to learn from each other what the best treatments are which I imagine are mostly diet, supplement and excercise related.I'll post again with things I have learned over the years and would appreciate it if other would also, specifically with regards to nutrition.",

            "answer": "This is my second post to this board.My symptoms are tiredness and fatigue, mental fogginess as many of you have described. Also have Migraine headaches, since so many of us complain of headaches I wish a study would be done on the relation of BTM and Migraines. Only medication that works for my migraines is Immitrex. I have both the pills and the injectable prescriptions, headache is gone in 15 minutes with Immitrex, and nothing else woks.I get fewer headaches when I eat right and exercises. With BTM we are very susceptible and very sensitive to food. Proper nutrition for everyone is important but for us it's essential because without it we wont have the energy to exercise.I try to stay away from bread, pasta and rice as these things tend to increase the fatigue and fogginess in my mind.For me proper nutrition is mostly Fruits, Vegetables and lean meats. I feel that I must eat lean red meat cooked rare, I also eat chicken fish and shell fish. I recently purchased a vita mix blender check it out here,https://secure.vitamix.com/acb/stores/4/Vitamix-5200-with-48-oz-Container---NEW-P2332C0.aspxExpensive but I purchased mine at Costco for $399 new. The Vita Mix is a life saver for me because it makes it easy to get all the fruits and vegetables in every day. For some reason I crave spinach but hate to eat it. I make several drinks in the Vita Mix blender that contain spinach and broccoli and it taste great. And unlike a typical juice machine that discards all the nutritional fiber and other nutrients, everything stays in the Vita Mix blender and gets pulverized into liquid.For me I think it would be very hard to stay on a diet of fruits, vegetables and lean meats without the Vita Mix blender. Since purchasing it and using it I feel much better, my body is finally getting the greens that it has been craving.Recently I discovered that pushing myself too hard with exercise over and extended period of time will bring my hemoglobin count down. High for me is 12 but if I push myself too much working out for too many days in a row it will drop to below 10. I found this out this past summer when I had entered a bike race that was several days long, my legs wouldn't recover and I almost passed out. I went to a Hematologist and he told me that any Doctor that told me I wouldn't have any effects or symptoms from my BTM was dead wrong, \"finally Vindication\". The Doctor told me that Tennis Pro Pete Sampras has BTM and that if he doesn't win the Match quickly in the fist few sets that it's over for him that he will be exhausted and if the match goes too long he is whipped out and loses. I wish a study would be done on how excessive exercise effects Hemoglobin levels in people with BTM.I hope that others will post some of the things that they have been using to help them cope with the symptoms of Beta Thalassemia Minor, because we all need to learn from each other what works and what doesn't work.",
