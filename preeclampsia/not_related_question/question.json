            "answer": "Preeclampsia is high blood pressure and protein in the urine. It doesnt develop until after 20 weeks, but can be very dangerous for you and baby if untreated and it progresses. The cause is unknown, but can be treated with activity restriction, diet changes, and sometimes meds. If untreated, it can eventually progress into eclampsia, and then to HELLP syndrome (whooole different issue). Signs of preeclampsia you can notice at home are presistant headaches, seeing spots, decreased urine output, right upper abdomen pain, and sometimes difficulty breathing (fluid in the lungs).I took this all right out of one of my nursing books and simplified it. Hope it helps! :)",
