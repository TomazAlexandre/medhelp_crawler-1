You may want to ask your o.b. this question \"which will cause more damage to my babies, xanax or stress hormones\".. I really don't know what his answer will be, because only he will know the severity of your anxiety based on what you tell him. But no matter what, be honest, don't over embellish. Think about your little ones and concentrate on a healthy pregnancy and the attacks will come less frequently. I wish you lots of luck..",

Dont look on the internet for negative things that will be my goal for the next time I try to get pregnant.

Now, I am happy, the baby is doing well, and no side effects. I take 50mg of Zoloft every morning, and I am not the only mommy to be on this site that takes it.

I was on xanax 0.5 mg extended release and it helped me out a lot.\u00a0\u00a0my md insisted on getting off the medication due to becoming addicted to it. About a month ago i slowly started tappering off going to xanax 0.25 mg to half of that every other day its been 2and a half weeks and i havent used it sure i got withdrawal symtoms like muscle spasms on my neck, anxiousness and nausea but it went away and now im five weeks pregnant! i had a miscarriage a year ago not on any meds and im sure if you talk to your doctor he'll find a way to help you and keep you comfortable. Im focusing on my baby to keep me from taking any, but trust me if i find myself needing one (since my husband will be leaving to afghanistan in two weeks) i will ask my obgyn if i could take half of one. Try exercise it sends endorphins to your brain and therapy with a counseler but dont rely on xanax for it only numbs the feeling find out what triggers your anxiety and dont give up, keep busy and go to church.

He said the risks of stress related effects on the baby are greater than the risk of me only taking the xanax when I need them. I don't take them every day but do take one every couple days when needed. I hold out as long as I can until I can determine if I will get over the attack or not. Taking a bath and deep breathing, sometimes screaming in my pillow for a few minutes will make the attack go away. I only allow myself about 10 minutes until I know I need the xanax.I think it is based on your doctors experiance with the drug during pregnancy and also how bad your attack get and what physical changes you have during these attacks.",

About 2 years ago I also started suffering severe panic attacks and thus became agoraphobic, never wanting to leave the house.I never went on meds for this, I did take them years ago when I first started getting anxiety attacks, but I felt they weren't much help. Medications are not a cure, they are necessary when severe and you can't cope any other way, but anxiety is not something that goes away, it does get better, but it is important to learn coping methods.I got over my agoraphobia and stopped having panic attacks by meditation and relaxation, yoga, learning breathing techniques and undertsnading my thoughts. I also don't panic when I start to have anxiety symptoms, I just let those 'feelings' pass through by sitting down or lying down and just 'watching' them pass (it sounds scary, but it works) I used to find by trying to distract myself it made them worse, I guess becauise I was active and moving and thus more stressed.I'm now 8 weeks pregnant, extremely tired, nauses all day/night, loss of appetite, and am just overall exhautsed by all the changes.I think it's because of the lack of control I feel, but I have not left the house in 2 weeks and also because I feel so sick all day. I'm hoping it's not just my anxiety, but I think it is, which is frustrating because I was doing so well.I've been told by my obgyn that by week 12 the sickness and tiredeness will go away and I should have more energy, so I'm hoping this will lessen the anxiety. So far it's a wait and see and I'm just going to stay in bed, relax and not feel bad about it.If I still have the anxiety after this, I will definately be back on my relaxation path of meditating, yoga, and possibly getting some cbt therapy to help with my thought processes.",

A week or two later I started with my anxiety/panic attacks again. I have had anxiety/panic for 5+ years- was on Effexor 75mg and Xanax .25mg as needed. Before I got pregnant I went to a high risk OBGYN and they told me to take Zoloft during pregnancy, not Effexor. I am on 175mg of Zoloft now and still feel anxious. I called the OB and they said to take Ativan .25mg when needed, but not daily. It does help some.. I started to see a therapist as well and she tells me that after our hormones level off alittle anxiety usually decreases as well.Just know- we are never alone. There are so many pregnant women dealing with this horrible anxiety. I am not sure how on some days, but we make it through each day and it just has to get better! It does not feel it on many days, but just close your eyes and remember yourself at your happiest moment in life- and know that we will get there again!!!!!

There are alternative medication for anxiety which do not pose as high\u00a0\u00a0a risk. You had three children already. I understand not wanting to stop for yourself, but once you became pregnant, it is no longer about yourself. Piece of advice. Get some sleep. I was having panic attacks after my second child. It was almost like post traumatic stress. I went without sleep for so long so much that when I could sleep, I would have a panic attack. Being well rested will eliminate much of what you are going through including depression which is ultimately related to your seritonin levels, ie sleep. You don't need medication if you get natural rest. I hope you can afford a Nanny or have lots of help. It is time for your husband to get his tube tied. Once your youngest is 3, you will return to normal again. Good Luck",

Does anyone have any advice or some encouraging words for me. I really feel lost, confused and so many other symptoms that go with this disorder. Thanks for your time!",

I was diagnosed with panic disorder when I was 22 years old and have been on xanax or klonopin since then, with the exception of my pregnancy almost 3 years ago. I have also been on Paxil, on and off throughout the years. At the time of my last pregnancy, we were planning on becoming pregnant and everything was planned out. I was off all meds when I found out that I was pregnant. Afer our daughter was born, I had to return to the klonopin when she was about 3 months old. I also returned to Paxil shortly thereafter.4 days ago, I found out that I am pregnant. Only this time, I had no time to wean myself off any medications. I was taking Paxil and Xanax. When I saw the results from my test (home pregnancy test, as I have not been to my first ob appointment), I stopped taking all the meds. I called my doctor that prescribes the anxiety medications and they said yes, discontinue all meds. My ob said only to discontinue the xanax and to continue the Paxil until I come in for my first appointment on Aug. 18th.I am nervous because of the info I have heard in regards to Paxil....and I am not sure how long it remains in your system. I DID discontinue all meds, and am going through horrible withdrawl symptoms. I have not taken anything though. But I can tell you that with these type of side effects, it is SO hard. I feel like I have it double, because of the xanax withdrawal and the Paxil combined. Any suggestions? And is it better to have these horrible symptoms from discontinuing the medication or to take the medication itself? The way that I am feeling cannot be good for the baby. Please help.....",

I turned agoraphobic and started developing OCD and was unable to go to my college classes out of fear of having a panic attack. The doctors prescribed every medication. Although it helped, they also had many side effects. I also became addicted to Ativan during this time because I would ALWAYS \"take as needed.\" Tired of feeling numb and a prisoner to the meds., I decided to try other options. If you are able, I highly suggest seeing a Cognitive/Behavioral Anxiety Specialist. After being told I was the worst case he had EVER seen, I was able to taper off all medication and I'm not afraid anymore of my panic attacks. Once you stop avoiding, stop being fearful of what may happen, the panic begins to lose its power. Now this is definitely easier done than said- it takes hard work, but eventually you start learning about how to deal with the panic feelings. I'm finally getting my life back and it feels absolutely amazing! I wish all of you the best of luck! Just know there IS hope! Try other options rather than just the medications- all they do is cover up the symptoms, rather than dealing with the problem. My husband and I are planning on getting pregnant soon, and I can't be happier! I now have the tools and resources, and though it might be difficult, I know I will be able to do it now.",

Like any therapy it takes time. Insist on going for lots of sessions even if the hypnotherapist thinks you are 'cured' after one or two sessions. In the past I have emailed the therapist before a session explaining ALL(bad and good) of my problems from birth right up until present day.

I had panic attacks pre-pregnancy for about 5 years and was on 25 mg Paxil and .5 mg Ativan (as needed). I went years without needing the Ativan, and was doing great. Then, I found out I was pregnant and my OB switched me to Zoloft and advised me not to take the Ativan. Switching from Paxil to Zoloft was a very difficult 2 weeks for me, but I managed. At about 12 weeks pregnant, I ended things with the father due to his abusive behaviors and addiction to drugs. This was hard for me, but my anxiety was manageable. That was up until about 20 weeks pregnant. I have gone totally downhill and my anxiety is the absolute worse it has ever been. My doctor switched me to Welbutrin about two weeks ago, but I have not seen any results yet. I am barely able to make it to work, and have become agoraphobic (spelling?). I hate to admit It, but I have even broken down and taken .25 mg of Ativan when the anxiety was so overwhelming that I could not handle it. I am terrified I am harming my baby by feeling this way, and I am driving myself crazy. I pray that these feelings will go away after delivery, but I just do not know how I can handle another 7 weeks or so.",

I have not had an attack in a couple of months now and I thank God.It's not easy but until you realize that you worry in vain, you continue to wallow in this mess called anxiety! -it is all in God's hands, you have to let go and let God.I know its easier said than done but that's the ultimate because regardless of how much we worry, nothing much we do other than worry more...Wish you all the best and all other mums out there battling with anxiety and panic attacks in pregnancy.",

            "answer": "Believe me, if you suffer from severe anxiety, taking your medication (depending on what it is) outweighs the side effects. Last year me and my husband decided to start trying to get pregnant and I made the decision to taper off my xanax and prozac. My anxiety level was ok the first trimester, but when the stress that comes along with bringing in a little one to the world started to set in, my anxiety went through the roof. The anxiety and stress caused my blood pressure to peak unexpectedly during an attack, and because I was unaware of the signs this led to the onset of preeclampsia ( hypertension during pregnancy). My placenta ended up separating because my blood pressure was so high, and my son passed away just 3 weeks before my due date. So talk to your doctor, of coarse, because in some cases the benifit of the medication outweighs the risk.",

I read an article from a world renouned obgyn who stated they have done many many studies on zanax while pregnant. It turns out zanax has little to no impact on harming the baby. It will actually cause more stress on the fetus to stop them.. due to withdrawl & more stress on baby. If u do decide to stop you shoud ween yourself of off them very very slowly. It can take up to 6months to completely taper off depending on how long you have been on them.",

            "answer": "So I'm really glad I found this site and that I'm not alone in having really bad anxiety while pregnant. I am close to 8 wks now and am in recovery from drug addiction. I was on heroin when I found out I was pregnant. I obviously quit and got back on a very low dose of Suboxone, which is Category C b/c they don't know much about it during pregnancy; they do suggest switching to Subutex, which I will be asking for from my doctor on the next visit. But I am still having horrible anxiety, partly due to quitting heroin, partly b/c of hormones from pregnancy and partly b/c I suffer from anxiety anyways. My problem is that b/c I'm a recovering drug addict AND b/c I'm pregnant, I don't want to use benzos. But I don't want to keep feeling like this either. It's also making my morning sickness much worse. I plan on getting into some CBT and possibly yoga and acupuncture, but I'm wondering if I should go ahead and take a couple xanax just until I get the other stuff going. If I do, I'm afraid of it hurting the baby, especially since I used before I knew I was pregnant, I'm already high risk. What do I do? If I tell my OB I used I'm afraid he/she will automatically classify me as a drug seeker and if I do need meds, they won't give them to me. I stay worried about the baby all the time and I'm so sick of feeling this way! My fiance is very supportive but I still feel lonely a lot and I have horrible nightmares almost every night. Should I tell my OB about the prior drug usage or should I just tell them my symptoms and let them decide what's best?",

I am curently 30 weeks pregnant with my first baby and have had a pretty rough go of things.\u00a0\u00a0I was on xanax and several other drugs every day but stopped when I found out I was pregnant. My husband and I were trying to get pregnant for two years so we had a lot of time to anticipate the challenge of going off these meds and to research other options. This is what I've found.A couple options that are safer for baby that you can ask your doctor about are buspar (a non-benzo anxiety medicine: category b) and hydroxyzine (category c). Hylands also makes an over the counter pill called calms forte that has helped me a lot.\u00a0\u00a0It's pregnancy safe, although a little pricey. I have alternated using these medications (under a drs. care of course) and although things have still been rough, they've helped me manage the worst of it.One other thing that has helped that I'm sure people will have mixed opinions on is acupuncture. I'm not sure it helps the anxiety, but it has helped control the hormones that come along with pregnancy and can make anxiety worse (it also helps with constipation which is a big annoyance in pregnancy!!)\u00a0\u00a0I hope this information helps!",

After finding out i was pregnant! i wish it was planned so that i had time to wean myself off of the Klonopin before i got pregnant so that it didnt have to be so quick and sudden! they had just given me my usual klonopin and advised me to start prozac and i bought a pregnancy test before starting my prozac and found out i was pregnant didnt start taking it but continued the klonopin as i am now weaning myself off of this now its a HORRIBLE feeling as i am so addicted to it after taking it for 4 years but i have to do what is best for the baby and everyone has told me klonopin cant be continued as it is a category D. So if you are trying to get pregnant i would DEFFINITLY recommend starting to wean urself off of them (ask your doctor)\u00a0\u00a0so that when you do get pregnant your not overwhelmed about still being in the prozac and your body will have time to get used to the change. Good luck!",

I have suffered from this disorder all my life and have had 3 other children while not taking anything, just in the last 2 years have I been taking xanex .25 to .5mg a day. I am now pregnant with twins around 8-9 weeks. I am horriably afraid to stop taking these and am also afraid of the side-effects of the drug itself on the babies. I was just wondering if there's anyone out there that has gone through this and if so what advice do you have for me.",
