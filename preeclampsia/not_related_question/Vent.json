Seems to me your fiance's mom is being a little selfish in taking the money from you guys all the time, our making you feel bad for spending it. If you are spending money on things your baby needs, you are not just \"spending money on yourself\".I wound up having my first baby at 35 weeks and didn't realize it until 2 days before (due to preeclampsia). We didn't have the nursery set up at all, and I highly regretted it.Try sitting down and talking to her and tell her you need to buy things now. If anyone else buys you the same thing, you can just return it. But tell her you have to prepare, and you don't have a choice.If she doesn't understand that, then I would seriously consider the move.Good luck. Hope things get better for you soon!",

Where would your baby sleep you can have your baby early or later and you still have nothing. My mom told me to wait until my baby shower but I still got her somethings because I don't trust people. They tell you one thing and do another. Right now all you should be thinking about is you and your baby and if you mom and dad will help go about your busy for your child. I know it's hard to leave because your bf is one place and you other but yall will come back together once she is born just get everything you need for her now.",
