I'm high risk also and I plan to ask my Dr to induce me if possible because im sorta in a similar situation where I wanna be able to have everything set up with babysitting and such. And I want to be able for my husband to be able to request time off work. Last time he wasn't able to and it was hard. Seems like in your situation it would be the best.\u00a0\u00a0talk to your Dr about it too for some advice. Good luck",

    "question": "This is my 4th baby 2 beautiful daughter's 10 an 5 an an handsome lil man who is 19 months. I\u00a0\u00a0was induced with my oldest due to Preeclampsia 2 weeks early. My second\u00a0\u00a0was natural super smooth labor. An I chose to be induced at 39 weeks with my son. Glad I did\u00a0\u00a0cuz he had cord wrapped around his neck. But it was an awful labor an it hurt like hell. I've not had the best with being induced. The reason I'm Considering It this time is convenience. I'm an single mom the baby father an I are talking but we don't live together. An my dad works who I currently live with. An my aunt an my mom live an hour away. An I'm high risk cuz of too much fluid. So if I think I'm in labor I have to go straight to the hospital. So if I get induced I can plan babysitter ahead of time. But I'd really prefer natural labor. But the I risk not having a sitter in time. So wats ur opinion ladies? Induced or just wait?",
