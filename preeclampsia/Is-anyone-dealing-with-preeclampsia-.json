            "answer": "My pre-eclampsia wasn't detected til a few weeks later but as soon as my urinalysis changed my do tor order delivery. My son was born at 36weeks to the day and has done extremely well. No effect from being a bit early. I can't say but after 30wks baby is very well developed and should do well after delivery with minimal to no interventions....if you are getting sicker it is also better for both you and baby to have baby a little early. Prayers all will go well and you can keep baby in for longer.",
