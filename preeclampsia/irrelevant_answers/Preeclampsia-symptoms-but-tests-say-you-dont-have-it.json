    "question": "Please answer me ladies.... I had preeclampsia with my first, came at the end very very suddenly... I lost 40% of my blood and it was a terrifying thing.My doctor keeps testing me as I'm high risk since I had it before.My bp and tests say I don't have it...My body is screaming that I do. Finally looked up the symptoms tonight and I have every single symptom... Which is my gut feeling as well and I'm shocked that I gave every single one and she knows about all of them... Taking my blood and ignoring the symptoms... Not sure what else to do.If I don't have it fine. Great! But my gut is telling me something isn't right.Did you have it and go undetected?? I'm scheduled to be induced 3-2-15, I'll be 40 weeks... I could go into labor at any time already dilated to 2cm and 60%effaced, doctor did a sweep yesterday.Going to call and talk to her Monday, I'm a wreck yes I want him out, healthy and safely but this is my biggest fear coming true and I feel like it's going undetected.",
