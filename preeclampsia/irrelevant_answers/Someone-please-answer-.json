            "answer": "My sister always measured two weeks early with hers. It's very normal. Also, they shouldn't take signs of pre ecclampsia lightly. It can be very dangerous if ignored. I'm assuming you go to weekly appointments, so I'd pay attention there as well. High blood pressure is 140/90 (only one number has to be high). If you were only slighlty elevated I wouldn't be overly worried, but it is definitely something they should want to monitor closely. Have you had abnormal amounts of swelling?",

She also said a big' baby house' doesnt mean a big baby.. and fundal height measuring isnt a particularly accurate way to determine fetal size. As for the blood pressure.. probably best to get that checked properly",

            "answer": "Just to be aware, that every Dr measures the fundus slightly different because it's all done by feel. Normal to have different reading by different Dr's. I would say the ultrasound is more accurate as long as it was done by someone with medical certification. In Canada those scans are done just for fun and pics, no medical info or measurement are given. Try not too worry, they probably just want to make sure baby is still growing properly. Sounds like your in good hands.",

    "question": "So at my appointment today my fundal was measuring two weeks ahead so my dr wants to do a growth scan. Now this is very odd to me because two weeks ago I went to a place for fun to have a 4d sonogram and they told me my baby was measuring a week behind... has anyone ever measures ahead for their fundal and behind for there babies growth??? Or maybe my baby had a growth spurt in the last two weeks? If anyone has experienced anything like this id like to hear the result! And also I'm at the later stages in my pregnancy 35 weeks so I have been seeing a new dr every visit because they want me to meet them all incase my dr can't be there for the delivery. Now at my last appointment two weeks ago I had a very experienced dr and there was trace amounts of protien in my urine and my blood pressure was slightly elevated. I asked him if I could have pre eclampsia and he said no there would be protien in my urine, trace amounts are normal, and then he took my blood pressure again for me while I was laying down and it came back normal. So at my appointment today with a different less experienced dr everything was the same trace protien and blood pressure slightly elevated and she seemed very concerned and is sending me for more tests for preeclampsia. I'm just curious as to why one dr would not be the least but concerned and another one would??? Anyways it's just got me worried",
