            "answer": "take the epidural...I was induced with both my girls first with no pain medication the second with an epidural..i will not sugar coat if you lose focus on your breathing you wont ever gain control of the pain again it is a very fast pain not the gradual work up to it pain all of a sudden when labor picks up its full power...anyone who has been induced will tell you it doesn't make you a bad person to take the pain medication ...unless you have a high pain tolerance it simply isint possible to do without it ... good luck as soon as its over you totally forget all the pain and just focus on that lil face !",

            "answer": "I agree. If youre scared as a ftm some pain meds would be good. I dont know if youve had contractions much yet, but induction takes you from a 1-2, to a 6-7, right away! It can be a difficult adjustment. I had my water broken and pitocin on my first and it was fast moving after that.",

            "answer": "It will take a few hours...8-10 hrs as opposed to 18-22 hrs...they will prep you..possibly an enema..I.v. will be started a lot of it is monitoring ..then they will break your water you will progress from there..but once you start dialating it will progress quick.....and just so you know if you want it as an option the epidural blovks your pain but does not paralyse you as some think you can feel your legs it just feels very numb...but I promise as soon as its over the rush will have you forgetting all about the pain it is a natural high like no other to gaze upon your newborn baby...take lots of pics even of things you think you won't want to see because you\u00a0\u00a0won't remember and pics are a good way to recall",
