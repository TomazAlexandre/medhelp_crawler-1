    "question": "I'll be 33 weeks tomorrow and at my appointment yesterday my baby was breech. I have had high bp the entire pregnancy and my doc said I would most likely be induced at 39 weeks for fear I'll developing preeclampsia. My next ultrasound is on the 29 and doc said if baby is still breech they will schedule a c-section.I don't want one. I delivered my son vaginally 8 years ago and would prefer to do the same with my daughter. I know I still have time for baby to turn, but are there any exercises I can do to get her moving? I saw someone mention a website a while ago but u don't remember what it was. With my other possible complications and the baby being breech I'm afraid the doc won't really try to help me get the baby to turn and just go ahead with the c-section.Any advice would be welcomed!",
