            "answer": "A repeat FNA is reasonable, but the nodule does not likely explain the overall symptoms (unless this is a \"hot nodule\" which would not likely need repeat FNA and could cause hyperthyroidism).Would need to correlate w/ TSH/T4 levels and medication to see if thyroid hormone status is balanced.\u00a0\u00a0You mentioned \"anti-thyroid\" drugs but did not give detail on this or the reason for presumed hyperthyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0If you have questions, a second opin from another endocrinologist may be appropriate.",

            "answer": "I feel as if my symptoms are being ignored. I was diagnosed with a thyroid nodule in early 2008 as part of an exam.The \"history\"They sent me for a thyroid ultrasound and the results were- Right lobe measuring 4.7 X 1.3 X 1.4cm and the left lobe measuring 5.3 X 1.5 X 1.9cm. Isthmus measured 3mm. There is a complex mass in the lower pole of the left lobe of the thyroid gland measuring 2.7 X 1.5 X 2.4cm. This contains both solid components as well as areas of sonolucency. They suggested a FNA biopsy. I did the biopsy and the results were 2.7cm\u00a0\u00a0predominantly cystic nodule with internal echogenic debris. It was benign.I was happy and didn't think much about it. Until I started gaining some weight a year later. So I had another ultrasound done. The results were: 2.8cm complex predominately cystic nodule which was unchanged from the last exam. Lobe measured 5.9 X 1.3 X 1.7 cm. Isthmus measured 0.24cm. Right lobe was 4.2 X 1.2 X 1.5cm.My PCP did another ultrasound in 2010- Right lobe measured: 4.2 X 1.1 X 1.5cm and was homogeneous in echotexture. Left Lobe: enlarged. measuring 5.5 X 1.3 X 2.1 cm and contained a large dominant mass in the lower pole which is of mixed echogenicity but contains some cystic components. It measured 2.9 X 1.3 X 2.1 cm. It demonstrates predominantly peripheral flow but there is some flow noted centrally. And he repeats in his report 3 times that it has been previously biopsied and benign tissue was obtained.",

    "question": "The now \"real\" problemI got pregnant in March of 2012- blood work and exam from my PCP was perfect 2 months prior to me conceiving!When I went for the first round of blood work for my pregnancy and they said I had hyperthyroidism. I do not have any of those lab results with me. But I started getting heart palpitations- over 100 sometimes over 120. My blood pressure was elevated by the end of the first trimester. I saw all sorts of specilist. Endocrinologist, Cardiologist, and a maternal and fetal medicine doctor. I was put on metoprolol. I got preeclampsia and had my baby early. Everything is fine. I'm still having symptoms now 5 months later. Severe hot flashes, head aches, throat feels slightly constricted, loosing my hair(about a month now), not sleeping(not due to the baby) and its really effecting my life. But my blood work is coming back normal. I'm on anit-thyroid medication and blood pressure meds. I had to beg to get an ultrasound. And they said it hasn't significantly changed its now: Left Lobe: 5.6 X 2.2 X 2.1cm mass is 3.1 X 1.7 X2.3 cm isthmus is 3mm. I had to then again beg to have another FNA biopsy done which I should get done this week. I will post my history after this, there wasnt enough space. Please let me know what you think. I have a family history of thyroid cancer on both sides and I know something is not right with me. I don't feel right and think I should 5 months after delivery. Thank you.",
