I did eat bananas and boiled potatoes today so I've done pretty good. Well since like Saturday night or Sunday my foot has been swollen I'm keeping it up while I'm sleeping and its okay when I wake up sore but not swollen and by the end of the night I can't bend my foot, only my right side not the left.
