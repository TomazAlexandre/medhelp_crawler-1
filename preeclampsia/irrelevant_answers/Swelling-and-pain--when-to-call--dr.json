            "answer": "I experienced similar swelling when I was pregnant (puffy hands, Shrek feet, and you couldn't tell the difference between my ankles and my calves - \"cankles\" is the term, I believe).\u00a0\u00a0There was a certain point where within 30 minutes of getting out of bed, my feet would get very swollen, so being worried about preeclampsia I called my doctor.\u00a0\u00a0They didn't have me come in right then b/c I had an appointment the next day, but when I talked to the doc about it, she said that as long as my protein and blood pressure were good, I didn't have anything to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0It never turned into anything other than serious water retention.But that being said, I would suggest at least giving your doc a call b/c it can't hurt (goodness knows I called my doc so often during my pregnancy that I knew all the nurses by first name).\u00a0\u00a0Let them decide whether it's something worth worrying about and they might even have you come in for more frequent bloodwork.\u00a0\u00a0And I wouldn't feel silly about calling the doc over these things... I think they expect to get many calls and concerns from pregnant woman... it's their job.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

I still get the flashing of lights and I get dizzy every once in a while but I have taken my BP at home a few times and it is good. Maybe I am being too lax but I dont really think I need to worry unless my BP is high so I am waiting until my appointment on the 15th.",

    "question": "I posted over in the pregnancy forum also but I wanted some advice from you ladies as well.I know this question has been asked a lot in some way or another but it's different when it is you lol.The past few days I have had BAD swelling all the way up to my knees and my hands are SUPER puffy as well. Along with the swelling my legs are soooo sore, they feel like I ran a marathon (I've never done that lol). They are also kinda tingly and I am loosing color in spots, like there is no circulation. The swelling finally went down over night but now I have only been up for an hour and my feet have been elevated the whole time and I can already see them swelling again. I had bad swelling at this point with Noah and it never escalated into anything bad (if that matters)I HATE calling the Dr. for silly little things so I am wondering if this is ok or if I should give him a ring. I wouldn't be able to get there today since Joe has the car so would it really even be worth calling him?Also, yesterday I was sitting down and I looked up and it was like someone had just taken a picture, I saw flashes everywhere. I have not been loosing any protein in my urine and my BP has been good so I feel like I really shouldn't be worried about preeclampsia but I saw my sister go through it so I am pretty scared as I saw what it did to her.",
