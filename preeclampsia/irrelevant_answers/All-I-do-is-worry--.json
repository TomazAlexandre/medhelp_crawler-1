With any question I asked the doctor if I get too worried I went to the hospital. Always best to be safe than sorry. But try and not worry although hard :)",

    "question": "So after finding out I had a little one on the way at twelve weeks and having to wait two dang months for my insurance to get straightened out I finally got to the doctor yesterday and got to see my little one (pictures posted, his eyes were open)! Seeing him wiggle around relieved a lot of stress. But now I'm just worried about the blood and urine test results! I'm pretty sure I have high blood pressure, even before getting pregnant, which has me scared about preeclampsia. I'm pretty sure I'm STD free but even knowing there's a chance I could have something is also worrying me. Sigh. So many joys and worries come with something so amazing. Anyone have any tips to help me not stress? They have me set up for two appointments on the same day in two weeks /:",
