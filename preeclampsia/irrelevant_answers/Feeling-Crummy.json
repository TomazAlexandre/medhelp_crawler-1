So it's just a waiting game. I have been hoping that I might start having contractions but we will see. I think I might ask to try a membrane sweep again before we start the prostaglandin gel. My doctor couldn't do it yesterday because my cervix was still too long. I was almost 2 centimeters dialated and soft, but not thinned. She just physically couldn't reach.",

This is just so different from my first pregnancy. I'm worried I won't bond the same with this baby. My first had me wrapped around her webbed finger at the first ultrasound. She was a surprise whereas this one was planned! I don't feel like I \"know\" this baby the way I knew my first before she was even born.But mostly I don't want to be induced. I will have my baby and be able to see those little feet that have been pushing out right above my belly button and all will be well. I just wish it didn't have to happen this way.",

I hadn't had a contraction for probably an hour, but now I've had 4 in about 15 minutes. They are tiny, I can talk through them and they only last 10-15 seconds. But it gives me hope that I will go into proper labor at home like a normal person. I feel much better about this whole thing. My labor nurse was awesome, too.",

My cervix is still too thick, and baby is really high, so they couldn't do a membrane sweep. I'm going back into the hospital Sunday morning at 7:30 for an induction. I'm not completely sure how it will go. My doctor said we might try two doses of prostaglandin gel followed by Pitocin. She also mentioned a pill I could take; I can't remember what it's called. But we will see! I ought to have my baby Sunday night or some time Monday. That will put me at 40+3 or 40+4. I am still looking forward to a medication-free labor and delivery.",

That was with my third dose going in. After all 3, my contractions were about 4 minutes apart but they wanted me at 2 minutes apart so they got me on the IV for some low dose Pitocin around 4 pm. My contractions are now around 2 minutes apart and have been for a little while. I was checked a little while ago, maybe around 5 or 5:30, and I was 3 cm. My blood pressure is too high for me to walk around but I'm allowed to get up and go to the bathroom or what have you, whenever I want. The nurse thinks Stella will come sometime in the middle of the night.",

    "question": "I will be 39 weeks tomorrow and I had my doctor appointment today. My blood pressure is a little higher than last week, so it's still rising. I also had a little protein in my urine. She didn't diagnose preeclampsia but I'm headed that direction so we set up a time to be induced. So I'm going in at 7:30 am Friday. I love my doctor; she explained that she likes to take it slow and avoid Pitocin as much as possible. We will be doing prostoglandin gel first.I know many people would be happy and excited, but I'm none of those things. I'm not even nervous (yet - once it's time to go in I probably will be). I'm really disappointed. I desperately wanted to have this baby all naturally, no induction. I was induced with my first, and I did it without an epidural, so I still think I can try no artificial pain relief (but we will see). That's a confidence boost but at the same time a crushing blow to my self esteem. It seems my body is incapable of going into labor in time on its own. If I had gone longer with my first, she likely would have died from lack of oxygen. If I don't have this one soon we could both die from preeclampsia or eclampsia. Without medical intervention I might not be able to have kids, and that bothers me way more than I thought it would.To top it off, it's the first week of school here, so I'm getting nearly constant reminders of my failure to be selected for a job this year (I'm a teacher). The past couple months I've had two really big failures, and I'm very disappointed. My husband points out that it isn't my fault, but that doesn't make me feel any better.I don't expect any sympathy or anything of that nature, but it usually helps to get these feelings out there, and off my chest. So to those of you who read through all of this, thanks for listening. I will post my labor/birth story this weekend, I suppose!Good luck to all of you August mommies.",
