            "answer": "IDK, my OBGYN will NOT do an internal on me simply because i'm having a csection and he believes it can trigger early labor and also infections.It's good that you don't have PE, but bad that you have hypertension.. it'll go away when you have the baby.And the meds make you feel drunk cause I think it dialates blood vessels and also makes you sleepy. (the migraine med they have me on makes me sleepy too)\u00a0\u00a0it's a cholesterol or BP drug I think. called Lopressor. But i\"m only on 25mg which is lower than a theraputic dose.",

            "answer": "XOXO- wow, are they expecting you to deliver early? How long until they wont stop your labor and just let it go? Isn't it like at 37 weeks?Ya, I just don't like the idea of taking medication while pregnant. I mean, come on, I wouldn't even take a tylenol for the longest time until about last week when my BP went up so high I was crying from the headache! I just wish there was another alternative rather than bed rest.What actually causes dilation and effacement? Is it gravity from being up on your feet? Or just pressure from the baby's head? If I am on bed rest, is there still a chance that I could be dilated or effaced at all? I am thinking that my doctor is going to give me an induction date on Monday. She mentioned it last time, but wanted to try bed rest first.",

    "question": "Hey girls... I was just curious if anyone has been dilated at all before they were 35 weeks. I go back to my doctors on Monday and she is going to do my first internal exam to see how things are progressing down there. Is it possible for me to even be dilated or effaced at all? Or is it too early? What were some of you ladies at almost 35 weeks?I also have an update to share. The good news: I DO NOT have preeclampsia. The bad news: I have Pregnancy Induced Hypertension. They put me on Aldomet for my blood pressure... but I don't like the way it makes me feel. I feel like I am drunk when I take it. I am still on bed rest and I am going to talk to my doctor about what else I can do to avoid taking this medication :(",
