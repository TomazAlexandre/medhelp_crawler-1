But i became pregant at the age of 18 only sexual active with my fiance (now husband) i had preeclampsia and my son was born 2 months early do to loss of all my amniotic fluid. i went on birth control for about 2 to 3 months after and then (becasuse im awful at taking pills on time..lol) I had an IUD. I kept it in for about 7 or 8 months and it gave me aweful periods that lasted 2 weeks more more and were only about 2 weeks apart so i had it removed went back on birthcontrol pills for 1 month and now i have not been on any birthcontrol for over a year.
