I do have some snacks: graham crackers, popcorn, etc. but even this late in the game I still feel super hungry all the time LOL and the no cheese just ticked me off today. The ham sandwich/burger mixup wasn't that bad LOL. With all this free time I have turned into the best student in my class completing and submitting assignments and homework days ahead of time in my online classes, so at least its made me productive. And I won't have to worry about assignments the first couple weeks after baby is born. Just something about that cheese really got to me today LOL.",

    "question": "So I was diagnosed with preeclampsia and have been on bed rest under a watchful eye at the hospital for the past two weeks. I hate being here, I'm always alone, people rarely come to visit because they clearly still have their own lives going on. I missed my son's open house and first day of school yesterday and to top it off they keep getting my food order wrong.I mean granted I am in a hospital and not expecting five star dining, but how do you make a quesadilla with NO CHEESE?!? One lady asked me did I ask for cheese on it? I asked her if I was ordering a pizza would I specifically have to ask for cheese? No its a given, the same with a quesadilla, and if they don't know what a quesadilla is they shouldn't advertise it on the menu. It was a bit rude and I felt bad afterwards but I'm pregnant and high risk and bored and lonely and moody and the least they could do is put cheese on my quesadilla LOL. I literally just ate toasted tortillas with dry chicken on it for dinner... grrrrrrrr.... and yesterday I ordered a hamburger and they bought me a ham sandwich on a bun... really?!? with all the hamburger toppings, just sliced ham instead of a burger patty. I really can't right now. I feel like I am going insane.On the plus side, only 4 more days until I'm induced and get to meet my princess. I am grateful for the care I am receiving and the safe delivery of a healthy baby girl but I can't wait to leave this place.Sorry guys, rant over.",
