            "answer": "I had preeclampsia with my first 9 years ago. I started to develop it at 7 months. mine's never got as bad as yours though. I ended up being induced at 39 weeks. Im now 37 weeks with #2 and only had 1 doctor visit with +1 protein in my urine which my dr. thinks it was because I was dehydrated. I still have maybe 3 weeks left and no signs of getting it again(fingers crossed!) Since you had it with your first your will more than likely be high risk and be monitored closely after 20weeks.",

I am praying it doesn't come back. So far I'm doing good. With my son I was going to be induced because of it but he decided to come on his own at 36 weeks and 3 days.",

            "answer": "I had preeclampsia in my first pregnancy and looks like I'm developing it again around 27 weeks. I was told it's more common if you had a large gap between children (mine is 5 years) but the reason my midwife thinks I've got it again is because this baby has a different dad. I've had very high blood pressure, swelling in hands and feet, headaches, blurred vision, and pain where my liver is. I go for fortnightly bloods and urine tests. I had baby monitored last week and she is good. I'm 31 weeks this week and have another midwife appointment tomorrow - will be interesting to see how I'm going",

    "question": "If you have been diagnosed with pre eclampsia in a previous pregnancy is it more likely to come back during your next pregnancy?I had severe pre eclampsia at 35-36 weeks and had an emergency induction/c section at 36 weeks. I'm worried it will come back. It was just the worst. My blood pressure spiked so high that I had a seizure during labor and I don't want that to happen again.",
