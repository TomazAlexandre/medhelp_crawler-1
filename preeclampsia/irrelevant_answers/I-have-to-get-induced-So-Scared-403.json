            "answer": "You can just say no! It's your choice. They can't induce you if you don't turn up at the hospital. From what you've said there doesn't seem to be any medical reason to induce yet? I would just wait if you're scared about it. My first was 11 days over, I just waited as I was scared of induction and felt no need to hurry the process synthetically, all went well...P.S. sex helped me every time! Don't need to be on your feet for that ;)",

    "question": "This is my Second, a baby girl. I have tried to do just about everything and my cervix is still not thinning out but baby is extremely low. Its a little frustrating especially since the 31st is long gone. I want to have her on my own with probably just an epidural. I'm scared the induction from what I've been reading will make Labor Rough. My son was late but by the time I reach the hospital I had already gone into labor on my own. Is there anything I can do probably not since my feet are so sore at the bottom. I'm home with my 3 yr old son as well and its hard to care for him because my feet but they don't sense preeclampsia.",
