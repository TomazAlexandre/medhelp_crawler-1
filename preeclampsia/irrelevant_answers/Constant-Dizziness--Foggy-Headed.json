            "answer": "Dear mam, welcome to the medhelp neurology forum. Thanks for writing in. You had preeclampsia during your pregnancy which progressed to eclampsia(convulsion after delivery)Your symptoms of persistent dizziness, visualizing floaters and mental blurring is most likely due to hypertension that has persisted following the delivery of the child. Almost\u00a0\u00a0one fourth of females with preeclampsia/ eclampsia are known to have persistent hypertension\u00a0\u00a0at the end of peurperium. I strongly believe that you need a physician consult for investigation of hypertension and need to take antihypertensives as soon as it is confirmed. This along with certain lifestyle modifications can make the scenario much better.\u00a0\u00a0Hypertension manifests as chronic headaches lasting for days, vertigo or dizziness, blurry or double vision, drowsiness, nausea, heart palpitations, fatigue, tinnitus and shortness of breath. You must get your blood pressure checked immediately and a basal record to be kept for few days. Eat low salt , non fatty diet, indulge in some form of moderate exercise,\u00a0\u00a0stay relaxed and stress free. An antihypertensive to be started alone or in combination till titrated to desired blood pressure for your age. A blood profile of hemoglobin, blood counts absolute and diffential,\u00a0\u00a0electrolytes, renal function tests including urea, creatinine and uric acid, blood cholesterol levels, electrocardiogram and chest xray. A fundal examination of the eye shows effects\u00a0\u00a0of hypertension on eye. Try to stay happy for the sake of small kids, things will definitely fall into places and improve once this is diagnosed and treatment started. Wish you all the best and hope to hear from you again.",

            "answer": "Thanks for you swift reply. I have been taking medications for hypertension I am currently taking Benzapril and Hct. I monitor my blood pressure daily at home with a digital blood pressure monitor. My blood pressure in the morning is 130/90 after my medication my blood pressure will remain around 120/75 throughout the day. So that's why I was concerned because I think that my vertigo has more to do with something other than my blood pressure, because my blood pressure is well controlled on my medication.I do also have high cholesterol in which i don't take medication for.I have just been modifying my diet\u00a0\u00a0to see if my cholesterol levels will improve. But I haven't heard any information in regards to cholesterol being a factor in dizziness. I'm just really worried that the seizure that I had has caused some sort of permanent damage.One doctor told me that I was stressed out and that could be the cause of my dizziness. I will make an appt with my eye doctor soon to see if there is something that can be done with my vision...",

    "question": "I had a baby in October 2010. I developed preeclampsia while pregnant,after delivery I had a gran mal seizure. After all that was over and done with I felt fine for a while despite elevated blood pressure levels. But a few months later I got really dizzy for no reason and that dizziness has stayed with me. I went to the ER they did an MRI and saw nothing in the brain to be concerned about. So I thought it would just go away. But here it is almost 1 year later and the dizziness is constant and in addition to it I have foggy/confused thinking. Shopping in a grocery store can become very confusing and overwhelming.Doctor after doctor says it's vertigo but vertigo meds make me feel worse. I don't know what this could be and I am not able to have much of a quality of life as I'm always in bed and unable to move around much. Even if I feel good in the morning at some point in the day the dizziness will come and it stays with me all day. I also had my tubes tied after delivery. Thyroid test show nothing is wrong. I wonder if I should have estrogen and other female hormones checked. I wonder if I have developed MS (but I have no pain at all. just an occasional headache)..I just don't know what to do and my doctors just keep telling me it's vertigo and anxiety. In fact I am anxious at times just due to the overall not feeling well...I don't know how much longer I can live like this. Please offer some advice or just something that I can take to my doctors and ask them to check!!!! Sorry so lengthy but believe it or not this is the condensed version...HELP ME PLEASE...I don't wanna be the woman on the autopsy table before they realize that something was wrong. By the way the dizziness is more so an off balance, tilting, unsteadiness sort of thing. And oh yeah there is something going on with my eyes. I can't really explain it other than I see floaters and there's this feeling in the eyes almost as if I can't stare at something to long without a fading kind of feeling...I don't know how to put into words the eye problems I feel...I have some nasal congestion & at times when I am at my worst with the dizziness my blood pressure will skyrocket.....Ugggggghhhhhhhhhhh frustrated!!!!!!!",
