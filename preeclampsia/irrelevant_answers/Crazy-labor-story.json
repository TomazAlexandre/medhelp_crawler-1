    "question": "I was admitted at 5 pm Thursday to induce at 38+5 for preeclampsia. I was given cytotec at 6:30, and another dose at 11:30. My water broke at 6:30 AM and I got my epidural an hour later. I was stuck at 4 cm until 1 pm when they started pitocin. When they checked me at 2:00, I was 5 cm. At 3:00, I was 7, and by 3:30 I was 9.5 and ready to push. They set everything up and I started pushing at 3:50 pm, and little Charles Gabriel was born at 4:04!!!! I had to be cut twice, and the doc kicked his head with the scissors. His heart rate was dropping fast so they wanted him out quick. Poor guy had the cord wrapped around his neck! He's okay, though he did end up with 5 staples in his head from the cut.He's 6 pounds, 15 ounces and 19.75 inches long. He's got a full head of dirty strawberry blonde hair and eats like a champ already. He's a spitting image of my grandfather and I haven't put him down yet. He's the 6th generation to carry the name Charles Allen, and the fourth living Charles Allen in the family.",
