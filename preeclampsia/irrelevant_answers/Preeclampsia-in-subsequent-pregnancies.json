            "answer": "I am a mom of 6 & had preeclampsia with my 5th and 6th child. Be very careful with the second pregnancy because not only can it come back but it can be more severe in subsequent pregnancies. I went to a different hospital for prenatal care for our last baby big mistake they did what your doctors did ignored the symptoms (despite prior history) because my BP wasn't high (it never was, it's possible to have hellp syndrome and preeclampsia without high bps) well I trusted my instincts and the fact that I am a nurse and went back to the hospital that delivered all of my other children safely, thank god I did! I had hellp syndrome and was immediately admitted and had to deliver 6 weeks early for severe preeclampsia and hellp syndrome and my bp was borderline even.during labor. Also it.seems like you may have chronic hypertension rather then preeclampsia as delivery would have helped if it was preeclampsia, so prior to conception try to get it under control. I hope I didn't scare you, it's also possible that you won't get it again, good luck",

    "question": "When I went into labor, my blood pressure shot up pretty high and has continued to be high since. My doctor and my midwife agree that I had preeclampsia because I have protein present in my urine the last few months and the sudden swelling/weight gain I had. I just found out about this, so I'm pretty upset that my midwife didn't do the necessary testing, and just wrote it off. I went in for birth control because I had an allergic reaction to the nuva ring, and my by was 150/100 so I'm now on medicine for a few months to help bring it down.My doctor told me that I was at risk for developing preeclampsia again during any subsequent pregnancies, and I was wanting to see if anyone who had it in their first pregnancy went on to have it again in their second? We aren't planning on getting pregnant any time soon, but for future reference (I've decided that I will be changing to an OB next pregnancy for what has happened) I'd like to be prepared.",
