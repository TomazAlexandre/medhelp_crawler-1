    "question": "I can truly just say how blessed i am to given birth to my beautiful baby boy, hes 1 pound and 14oz. 13 inches long at only 26 weeks, due to my preeclampsia. i am only 19 years old. And alone in this world. Baby daddy was with me but it was like if i was still alone. But its okay, i got really bad on the edge of a stroke and seizure and they rushed me into an emergency c-section. I just knew i had to fight for him. And i did. and hes perfectlt fine. Hell be in INCU for three months or so but i know he'll get the care he deserves! & well to my blood pressure hopefully they can finally get it under control. <3 i just please ask, to keep my son and i in your prayers. Because i\u00a0\u00a0i had him one day to another. Anything can happen one day to another also. Lets pray and hope for the best! #Thankyou",
