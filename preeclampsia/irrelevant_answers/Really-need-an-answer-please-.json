The office should have an after hours line, or they'll at least have a doctor on call who can answer your questions. What do you think happens when people go into labor in the middle of the night? Trist me, they're used to it :)",

    "question": "So yesterday I had to go to the hospital by ambulance because I had a seizure at home. They monitored my son and said he was okay and ran tests for preeclampsia and checked the fluid around baby. They said I only had 6 cm of fluid around baby (and that the normal amount is 10cm ) and that my tests came back on the borderline of preeclampsia so they discharged me and I will be going back for retesting on Monday. Today I stayed on bed rest like instructed but just now was the third time today that I randomly had to run to the bathroom to puke. It literally comes out of nowhere, there's no nausea or any warning I feel fine and then bam I have to throw up. I didn't have morning sickness at all with this pregnancy so idk is this normal or can it have something to do with the incident yesterday.? It's past midnight so I don't want to bug my dr if it may be normal I'm just worried it has something to do with the stuff from yesterday since I haven't thrown up my whole pregnancy. Sorry it's so long but I really need advice or opinions please.!!!",
