I'm glad that you were both ok as well, it's just scary being in that situation all I remember was going in for my weekly appointments and they were like are you ready to meet your son? I was like no lol my husbands at work and I need to go drop my car off. It just happened so fast. I'm currently going to another Dr with this pregnancy because my work cancelled my insurance the day before I got my IUD inserted and didn't tell me about it so I owe $1100 to the Dr's office before they will se me again, which ***** because I really liked him, and it would be a bonus since he knew EVERYTHING that went on throughout my first pregnancy, but this Dr isn't so bad he's just keeping a real close eye on me due to the preeclampsia =0)",
