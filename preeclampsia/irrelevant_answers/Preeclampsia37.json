            "answer": "My sister found out she had it due to excess swelling. She went into the local hospital and they sent her to a big city nearby to Parkview. She went in on Sunday and delivered her son at 26 weeks Wednesday. He lived 10 whole days. He was in the NICU and he just wasn't strong enough. It was so hard for our family. Preeclampsia is scary and you just need to watch for your symptoms if they worsen. My sister was at the point where if he didn't come out it was either she died or the baby did. She was shaving severe liver pain and all of her organs started to shut down. Preeclampsia is nothing to not be worried about. It's something that needs to be monitored and watched. Protein in urine, high blood pressure, headaches and blurred vision. Praying for you and your little one! Not all preeclamptic mommies have the same outcome. So I pray your little one makes it full term before you have to give birth! The older your baby is, the better chances it has.",
