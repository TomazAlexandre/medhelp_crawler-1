            "answer": "Your blood pressure is exactly (both numbers) what mine was last week. I am 31w4d. They were concerned and tested my urine for protein and there was none. They told me to come back in a week and I did on Tuesday. It was back down again at 112/70. I did nothing different, just tried to relax and reduce stress. I had preeclampsia with my first pregnancy and since this is my first pregnancy with my partner, the risk is up again. Have you asked your doctor if they have any suggestions? Are they monitoring you closely? I've done some of my own research about PIH and it is quite serious. I hope you can get yours to come down. I hope they check yours at the end of your visit and not just when you first get there. Lots of people get nervous and it goes up but then once they're relaxed at the end of the appt it isn't so high. Just knowing you have high blood pressure can cause it to shoot up in anticipation of them checking you!",
