    "question": "I am getting monitored every two weeks for preeclampsia. I have ultrasounds regularly on my heart and baby. Today I am nearly 14 weeks and my technician said let's see if bubs legs are open. We had a look and they were very much wife open, she said she can't be 99% sure but she thinks it will be a boy. It was very prominent and we seen there was something sticking up, but a lady told me the two dots at the bottom mean ovaries.I though the ovaries had entered the body by 10-12 weeks? Am I wrong??? I'm not getting my hopes up I just want bub to be healthy.",
