            "answer": "Try to stay calm! Might just be an off day - weather changes or nerves..I had a severe preeclampsia at 28 weeks and had to deliver within 2 days of diagnosis, but my BP was 180/120, protein levels were in the thousands, and the ultrasound showed that my baby hasn't been growing since 24 weeks.So even if you do get diagnozed, there are different levels of preeclampsia. Since your BP is not that high, they ll prob just put you on meds and close monitoring.In my case, my baby was born at 28 weeks weighting just 715grams. It hasn't been easy but she is 15 months old already and has just some feeding issues - we are working with a therapist, but otherwise she is doing great! Very healthy, running around, you won't be able to tell she was a micro preemie.I've also seen a lot of babies in NICU, including 24-25 weekers, you'd be amazed at medical advances these days!!! Obviously, the earlier the term, the more issues the baby might have, but many are able to overcome most or all of them! We had a 600gram 25-seeker next to us in NICU and she even got released before my daughter!! And after a few months at home, didn't need any more equipment or special therapies!!Good luck with the test!! Hopefully everything we ll be fine. But if it comes to the worst, stay strong, believe in your baby and the doctors and nurses!!",
