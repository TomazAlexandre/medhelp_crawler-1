            "answer": "Sorry to hear- how is baby doing?Its extremely upsetting having a bby in nicu- not knowing whats going on or the future.My baby was in nicu and I stayed in the hospital so I could see her when ever I wanted by walking up the corridors-Are you staying or already home?Try to keep positive and be honest about your feelings - the hospital might have a support group.Don't be too eger to get bby home nicu is the best place right now as bby should still be in the womb-They usually keep bby until they are 37week or at least 5lb. And spend as much time as possible in the nicu to try bond etc.Big hugs ... stay strong \u2661\u2665\u2661",

But my mom was extremely sick with my youngest sister and she was born at 27 weeks and was in the NICU for 3-4 months. It was incredibly hard for all of us, my mom just wanted her home. But what kept her same was that she was getting the best care possible and attention 24/7 so that if something did go wrong, she would get care immeadetly. 'My little sister is now turning 6 next month and the happiest little thing ever. It will be okay hun, but I'm sorry you have to go through this.",

    "question": "Has anyone had a baby born prematurely that has had to spend an extensive amount of time in the NICU.. I had my baby a little over 3 weeks ago at 28 weeks due to severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome and it's really taking a toll on me. I really want my baby to come home I feel really depressed because she's going to be there for at least another month maybe even longer... What was it like when you brought your baby home any advice / tips would be really helpful I never thought I'd have to go through any of this and my preeclampsia came on really quick so I had no time to prepare myself for all of this :(",
