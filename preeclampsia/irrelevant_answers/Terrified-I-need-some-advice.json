            "answer": "HiJust wanted you to know I bleed all the way through my last pregnancy, and the hospital was unable to find out the reason why.\u00a0\u00a0I ended up with eclampsia (I had a fit) and then complete placenta abruption at 24 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0The pain was incredible!\u00a0\u00a0I just remember feeling ok, was on bed rest anyways, I sat up and then felt a tingling sensation in my mouth (like popping/fizzing sweets) which then moved all over my body could hear like popping in my ears, then lights in my eyes.\u00a0\u00a0I called my OH and at that point passed out.\u00a0\u00a0Woke up sweating loads and the ambulance was on way, I then realised my belly hurt like mad and was contracting and not letting go.\u00a0\u00a0I had previous episodes of this prior but the contraction and pain never lasted long.\u00a0\u00a0I was back and forth to hospital and they could not find anything wrong apart from bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0I also had a lot of Braxton Hicks before this.\u00a0\u00a0Anyways at the hospital they gave me a pethidine injection and then (i was pretty out of it) realised it was placenta abruption and rushed me for c section.Baby is ok - all be it on ventilator nearly 7 weeks later has emyphesma and possible NEC.My 1st pregnancy I had pre eclampsia and was induced at 38 weeks, my son is now 8.Would love to share experiences.",

    "question": "Hello , I am writing because I need to vent and I am pretty freaked out..I am about 19 weeks pregnant now.It is my 4th pregnancy and it is extremely high risk. I have a history of 2 placental abruptions. (1 complete at 24 weeks- baby didn't make it) and one at 34 weeks. ( My daughter is now 5 years old and doing great. Thank God :) Last year I had a baby born at 34 weeks (Preeclampsia) with a congenital heart defect. WE did not know that she had a heart defect until after she was born. She lived for 2 months, had open heart surgery( we were given a 90% survival rate for her) and she passed away shortly afer surgery. Now I am pregnant again and have had\u00a0\u00a0alot of problems already. I've been bleeding and I've been having heart issues myself. I am terrified that either I will drop dead from this pregnancy or the baby will be born early/ and or have a heart defect. Anyone here ever gone through anything like this? I would like to chat if you have. Thanks for reading. God bless.",
