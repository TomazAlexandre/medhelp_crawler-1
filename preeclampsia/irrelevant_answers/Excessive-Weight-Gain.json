            "answer": "ok this is my story.\u00a0\u00a0I was 38 weeks went to the dr. I had gained 6lbs in 6 days.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse took my blood pressure and was shocked with my weight.\u00a0\u00a0Then left me in the room undressed from waste down..gotta love that forever.\u00a0\u00a0Short staffed dr. delivering. So I called my husband by this time I am crying because I have gained so much weight in such little time.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse practioner said \"oh honey don't worry it is just water weight\"\u00a0\u00a0I was soo swollen.\u00a0\u00a0They told me to watch my salt.\u00a0\u00a0So I came home and read everything I could online about this and pre-eclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0Freaked myself out.\u00a0\u00a0I read that a low sodium diet is 400-1000mg of sodium a day.\u00a0\u00a0So I decided to go to the grocery store and find things that were low sodium to eat.\u00a0\u00a0I did this and you cannot eat much on 1000mg a day.\u00a0\u00a0So I started this last week and with an exception to a bbq on sunday I have been eating this way since last Thursday evening.\u00a0\u00a0So hungry I thought I would be sick everyday.\u00a0\u00a0I went to dr. last night and all of that weight is now gone.\u00a0\u00a0I still swell some but not like I was.\u00a0\u00a0I told my husband forget it we are going to dinner.\u00a0\u00a0I ate whatever I wanted.\u00a0\u00a0It is mostly the heat that was making me swell.\u00a0\u00a0It is 105 degrees here.\u00a0\u00a0I would just watch it and try eating less sodium.\u00a0\u00a0If you actually look at things it is incredible what is in some things.\u00a0\u00a0Frosted mini wheats, water melon, fresh fruits and fresh veggies, a salad dressing low in sodium, which is hard to find. I used two cans of low sodium tomato sauce and some mrs. dash kind of stuff and some turkey burger and made spag. sauce.\u00a0\u00a0It was good.\u00a0\u00a0Try lowering sodium for a few days see if it makes a difference.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to ya.",

            "answer": "I freaked out at my last appt. I knew that I had gained weight, but i was expecting 4 lbs. or so. When she said 9 lb.s, i almost had a heart-attack! I thought I had only gained 5 before that and 9 lbs. was almost double. Turns out that i had only gained 3 lb.s before that but that means i TRIPLED my total weight gain in 4 weeks! Of course I rationalized it (i was wearing jeans & you should NEVER weigh in jeans and i had a lot of sodium the day before), but whether or not any of that made a difference i'll never know. I just had to focus on the fact that 12 lbs. at 24 wks. was not bad at all. And i think i'm hitting my big growth spurt (at least i hope!).",

    "question": "Ok so I am 34 weeks and I went to the doctor on Tuesday and since my last appt (3 weeks ago) I have gained 9.5 lbs I almost freaked out! I havent been eating any different and if anything I have gotten more exercise in the last 3 weeks then before. My BP was a little high and I am also swollen but do you think the weight could just be fluids that I have been retaining? Also has anyone been diganosed with preeclampsia? I had the tests done and have all the symptoms except spilling protien and should I still be concerned?",
