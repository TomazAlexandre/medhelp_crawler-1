            "answer": "I think there are others that have pain with their pvc's as well. I have occasional chest pain ( 1-2 times a week) but it only lasts a few seconds. Occasionally it will be bad enough that I'll also have pain down my left arm - that lasts a couple of hours. It makes no sense to me. I asked the cardiologist about it and he said he didn't think it was cardiac related. O...K....\u00a0\u00a0I'm still here so maybe he's right. It just seems to me if you feel the arrhythmia and the pain at the same time, there might be a connection. Have you worn a monitor and recorded some of those chest pain times?",

    "question": "Hi, I am a 35 yr old mom of 1.5 yr old quadruplets. I had high blood pressure during the last month of my pregnancy with severe preeclampsia all resulting in continued elevated blood pressure. Since the birth of the babies, I was on amlodipine with good pressure regulation but began to experience skipped heart beats about 1 year post partum. Doc switched\u00a0\u00a0me to metoprolol and a holter done with occasional pvcs and pacs. Echo was normal. I still experience occasional skipped beats especially when stressed or just dancing with the kids. This would not bother me too much but the chest pain radiating to my left arm after the skipped beats scares me. This can last for quite a few hours. Is chest pain associated with pac/pvc? Should I have my doctor work this up further.Thanks for any advice. As a mom of 4, I have a lot to live for and I don't want to be stressed out every time I have chest pain that I am also having a heart attack.",
