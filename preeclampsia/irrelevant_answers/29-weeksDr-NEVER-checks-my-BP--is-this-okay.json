I don't know what's around you, but a lot of drug stores sometimes have BP machines where u can check it. The induced my sis in law cause her BP got too high. Especially since you are swollen. Those are key signs of pre eclamsia.",

So they had to send me to the hospital that same day. My son was born in only 7 hours but then I bleed a lot and it would not stop. I passed out and the next day when I woke up the doctor told me I needed a blood transfusion. It took me a long time to recover from it and it also sunk me into PPD. Your story may not be the same as mine... but I would take caution.",

            "answer": "It is up to the dr's discretion whether or not to check th bp. It is however a good idea, but some dr's trust that most bp problems start later on in pregnancy. They also know your history and family history. My guess is that his routine will have your bp checked around 30 weeks or so.Also, they do count on the urine showing protein, etc. It can also be used for longer term checking than the bp check which is just the measuring of it at that moment.Some dr's will do blood work when trying to rule out PIH versus a fluke high bp reading. And in all reality, most women's bp goes up by just walking into the dr's office, then goes down upon exiting.Swelling in hands and feet are normal in pregnancy. Make sure to cut down on sodium-carbonated drinks, processed foods and fast foods. Elevate your feet as much as you can. The baby is growing and presses against the aorta (large blood vessel). This causes the blood to pool and swelling to occur.If you notice swelling that is going up the shin/knee area that doesn't go away with elevation, or sudden severe headaches, you should have your bp checked.Sorry this is so lengthy, best wishes to you and your pregnancy!",
