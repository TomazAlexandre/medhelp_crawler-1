            "answer": "Anything with a bottom number over 80, is high blood pressure. With the bottom number at 100 it is very high blood pressure requiring medication!so 135/100 is VERY BAD!The head ache is a symptom of the pre eclampsia, but make sure you mention it to your doctor anyway.The sex of the child has nothing to do with whether or not you develop pre eclampsia.You can expect that the doctor will probably recommend that you have an epidural when you deliver, as this helps keep your blood pressure down.You also may be induced early.",

            "answer": "The more rest you can get the better.\u00a0\u00a0Laying down on your left side with a pillow between your legs, is the best position for a pregnant woman.I had pre-eclampsia with my first pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Bad enough to be hospitalized for it.\u00a0\u00a0I stayed in the hospital for a week, when I was 8 to 8 1/2 months pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure stabilized with bed rest and I was sent home.My blood pressure went sky high when I finally went into labor a month later.\u00a0\u00a0That was 38 years ago, so they didn't do as much intervention then, as they do today.\u00a0\u00a0They now know that the high blood pressure actually has to do with high pressures in the placenta.\u00a0\u00a0Once the baby is delivered the HBP usually goes away, as you probably already know from your first baby.You can really help prevent hospitalization if you spend alot of time on bed rest.\u00a0\u00a0Any swelling, blurred vision or HEADACHES, should be reported to your doctor immediately.\u00a0\u00a0Pre-eclampsia is nothing to fool around with, as you already know.I am betting that they may put you in the hospital to watch your blood pressure and give you the appropriate medication and possibly deliver you early if your pressures are not going down.\u00a0\u00a0Here in the U.S. they usually give you an IV drip of Magnesium Sulfate to lower your blood pressure, if you are admitted to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0It also tends to stop or slow contractions if you are having any.\u00a0\u00a0It's great for getting the blood pressure down though.I honestly think you are looking at an early delivery.\u00a0\u00a0They will try to hold off as long as it is safe for you, to allow the baby some \"extra cooking time.\"Please take care of yourself and report all of your symptoms to your doctor immediately.\u00a0\u00a0No need to take chances with your health.Keep us updated if you can.\u00a0\u00a0We are all concerned for you.\u00a0\u00a0With medical science today, pre-eclampsia is better controlled than it was when I was having children.Best of luck to you and the little one,Heather",

            "answer": "I went to the doc last Friday and my protein was +2 in the office and the 24 hour urine collection was 500.\u00a0\u00a0My doc contacted a ob at a bigger hospital.\u00a0\u00a0She told me I was going in to be induced at 34 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I was pretty scared.\u00a0\u00a0When I arrived at the hospital they decided to monitor me.\u00a0\u00a0My bp was excellent...120/62 was the highest that they recorded.\u00a0\u00a0I was able to come home the next day.\u00a0\u00a0The 12 hour urine collection there was still abnormal.\u00a0\u00a0I was told to check in with my normal doc twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0Plus modified bed rest.I went on Tuesday to the doc's office.\u00a0\u00a0My regular doc was not in, but I was checked by another.\u00a0\u00a0My protein levels were clear.\u00a0\u00a0No trace.\u00a0\u00a0My bp was a bit high though.\u00a0\u00a0I don't understand how the levels can disapear.\u00a0\u00a0Is this normal or could there have been a mistake?I finally broke my week long headache.\u00a0\u00a0It comes and goes now.\u00a0\u00a0 I have stared with a dull pain under my rib cage more on the side than near my breast bone..\u00a0\u00a0It is constant.\u00a0\u00a0It is similar to the pain I had before I had my gallbladder out.\u00a0\u00a0Is this cause for concern?\u00a0\u00a0I know it is not the baby because he is low and it doesn't go away unless I take tyelnol.Thanks for your responses!",

    "question": "I had a tubal ligation in January of 2008.\u00a0\u00a0I became pregnant in May of 2008.\u00a0\u00a0I am currently 34 weeks along with my fourth child. My first born was a male, 12.5 lbs 24 inches, and born in Germany.\u00a0\u00a0I did have high bp with him.\u00a0\u00a0Because of the language barrier I am not sure if I was spilling proteins or not.\u00a0\u00a0I delivered him naturally.\u00a0\u00a0My second and third children both girls 8lbs 14ozs and 11lbs 8ozs.\u00a0\u00a0I had no problems with blood pressure or protein spillage during these pregnancies.I recentally started with higher than my normal bp readings.\u00a0\u00a0Usually around 120/60.\u00a0\u00a0Now I am clocking in around 135-145/80-100.\u00a0\u00a0I did have protein in my urine on Monday when I went in because of the high bp.\u00a0\u00a0I did a 24 hour urine collection and wont know the results until tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a tension headache for the past 6 days and I am experiencing arouses, and minimal swelling.\u00a0\u00a0Here are my questions:1. Is it possible for pre eclampsia to form during the pregnancy based on the sex of my unborn child.\u00a0\u00a0I do know that it is a boy and he is already 6lb 11ozs from an ultra sound 2 days ago.2.\u00a0\u00a0Can I still be diagnosed with pre eclampsia even though my bp is not too high?\u00a0\u00a0Or is it high?3. If diagnosed what should I expect to happen?\u00a0\u00a0My doc talked only about induction in a bigger hospital with a NICU.4. Should I go to L&D because of this constant headache?Thanks so much for taking time to read and answer.",
