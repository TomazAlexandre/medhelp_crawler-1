            "answer": "Pre eclampsia is the new name for toxemia. It can lead to Eclampsia which can cause seizures etc. I would tell your DR at your next appointment so they can test you and your blood pressure again. Swelling is very normal though. Check what you're eating and try to avoid things with a lot of salt. Basically my dr said you have extra blood during pregnancy and it just pools in your feet and hands and causes swelling. Drink water, at least 3 liters a day a ton I know but you need it during pregnancy. Also make a point to take regular breaks every hour or so to put your feet up. Put pillows under your legs so they're above heart level and put ice packs on them for 20 min at a time. You can take Tylenol also and see if that helps the pain and swelling. Its hard to rest while pregnant but you just have to make time. Work for an hour rest an hour etc. I'm sorry its so bad, unfortunately it's a common part of pregnancy. Feel better and good luck!",

            "answer": "I would call your doctor, he might want to see you. Until then cut out salty foods and make sure that you're drinking enough water. My feet swell to the point where I can't curl my toes at all :/ my doctor is useless though and just told me to stay off them as much as possible but also told me to keep working.",

    "question": "Of my legs and feet being swollen basically all day. It's a little less in the morning but the rest of the day nothing I do helps or makes it better. My hands now feel puffy but they've always felt a little puffy just not usually this far into the day (it's 1pm) unless its a rainy day. Do I need to give L&D a call? Is this a possible case of preeclampsia now? My BP has always been normal and only had protein in my urine once and showing no other symptoms but I know preeclampsia can lead to toxemia since my cousin had it with her daughter and she swelled up just like this where she couldn't get it to go down at all and they took her daughter a whole month early because of it. So any advice? I'm drinking enough water but I can't just lay around with my feet up all day waiting for it to go down as I have a toddler to take care of and a house to clean up for company later.",
