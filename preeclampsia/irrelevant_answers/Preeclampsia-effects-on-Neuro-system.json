            "answer": "Congratulations on your pg.\u00a0\u00a0I would think you are or should be considered high risk and being cared for by not only a regular OB but a perinatologist.\u00a0\u00a0I had cardiomyopathy and a PE during/after my third childs pg.\u00a0\u00a0 I complained for mths about symptoms and was not taken seriously, then of course I got REALLY sick.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest you go pick up the ph to a perinatologist and make an ASAP appt, or when you get symptoms go directly to urgent care or the ER.You clearly have a history of blood clotting and that risk increases when you are pg.\u00a0\u00a0Some blood work would help determine if you are high risk for clotting issues esp a D dimer test, plus they should be monitoring your liver function and general well being.The other thought would be to see a hematologist, often you will find one who is a hematologist oncologist in a practice that specialises in seeing pg women for blood clotting issues.\u00a0\u00a0At the very least given your hx I would think that aspirin and heparin would be approp treatments to consider for pg and 6 wks beyond delivery.\u00a0\u00a0At about 18 wks or so, the placenta and cord demands become larger, so the baby can grow.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the cord is clogged with a sludge type issue, if you have blood clotting issues, that directly affects the babies growth.\u00a0\u00a0Treatment is with aspirin and or heparin shots.\u00a0\u00a0This approach is much more mainstream than it was even 8 yrs ago when I first was dx during my first successful pg, so ask about it directly.Remember to mention your history EVERY time you see an OB for a review, they see so many people, its not so easy to remember all the info for each patient, so ensure you remind them every time.It could well be migraines during pg, that said, your symptoms with your history would suggest a full investigation is necessary.\u00a0\u00a0I found that when I was pg and on heparin shots, I never got a migraine, but when I am not on heparin (I was on that and warfarin for mths post third delivery) I never got a migraine - mind you I had plenty of other symptoms to keep me occupied :-)Best wishes for the remainder of your pg and I hope you do not deliver early this time.Fiona - Mom of 3, 4 miscarriages",
