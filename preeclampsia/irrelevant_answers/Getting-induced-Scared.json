            "answer": "Pitocin is giving thru an iv line.I was induced at 40+1 I was 4cm dilated already. I had to be there at 730am I was brought to a room where I changed in to a gown and the nurse set up the monitor's on my belly and got all the info they needed. At 930am they started me on pitocin at 1030/11am I got my epidural then the doc came in shortly after and broke my water which then put me at 5cm dilated. At 1pm I was at 10cm but baby was up higher than they wanted so they sat me up in bed to help scoot her down at 2pm they checked me again and got everything ready and at 238pm after 15mins of pushing my baby girl was born.",

            "answer": "Am I going to be allowed to get up and walk around if I do not get an epidural? I want to try and go all natural, but I've also heard getting induced causes the contractions to be stronger. I'm thinking of scheduling it for the evening because I'm more relaxed at night.",
