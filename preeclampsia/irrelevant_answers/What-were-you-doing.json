    "question": "What were you doing before you went into labor? Funny story lol. With my first pregnancy I was induced, but unaware I was going to be induced. I was 40+5, and was sent to the hospital for fetal monitoring to make sure the baby wasn't distressed or anything. Also, that morning I got a call saying I could come pick up my income tax check lol. So I'm thinking ok I will go to the hospital then go get my check, and go crazy shopping for my little bundle of joy! Well it didn't happen like that. I got to the hospital the nurse hooks me up then takes my blood pressure. I'm sitting there happy go lucky thinking about all the little extra things I'm about to go, and splurge on. So the nurse ask me did you run here? Lol I'm like nooooo my fiance (now my hubby) drove here. She than ask ok do you see spots? Or feel dizzy like your going to faint? I'm like no I feel fine actually I'm going to go pick up my income tax after this and go shopping for my baby girl. I will never forget her next statement! She said, no your not! You just cost yourself a ticket to l&d. My blood pressure was 190/89 or something like that. I'm like wait wait wait!!! Can I go do a little shopping first than come back lol She was like absolutely not! Lol I ended up having preeclampsia, and being induced. When I woke up that day I never thought I'm having my baby today. Took me totally by surprise. How about you ladies?",
