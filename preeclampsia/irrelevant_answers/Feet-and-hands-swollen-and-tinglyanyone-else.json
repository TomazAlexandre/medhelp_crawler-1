            "answer": "Hi! I definitely have the swelling issue and began getting it in the late 20s early 30s weeks (I'm 33w4d today).\u00a0\u00a0So, what to do...\u00a0\u00a0My OB suggested LOTS of water (I know, water is partly to blame, but it really flushes stuff out).\u00a0\u00a0Also, do not cross your legs during the day and walk around as much as you can.\u00a0\u00a0Keep your feet up as much as you can, too.\u00a0\u00a0This is all for foot stuff.\u00a0\u00a0For the hands, the water is the main thing and try to keep your arms elevated when you can (for the tingling, too).\u00a0\u00a0Finally, really reduce your salt intake.\u00a0\u00a0As much as that blows (I love salt), it really does help.\u00a0\u00a0After a night of Chinese, my feet will swell like balloons!\u00a0\u00a0I had to take my wedding rings off two weeks ago (bummer).\u00a0\u00a0But, some of this is normal pg stuff, too, so we just have to live with it some.\u00a0\u00a0And, the hot weather (not sure where you are) will most certainly keep the fluids retained.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck, and I'll hope for it to be under control more than your first! :)",

    "question": "Hello ladies, I just got back from a blood pressure check. I emailed my doctor to ask her if I should be concerned with swollen feet and blurry vision at 26 weeks. She told me to come over and get my bp checked just to make sure it's not preeclampsia. I did get that with my first pregnancy quite bad, had to be induced in an emergency the next morning due to lots of protein in the urine, VERY high blood pressure, hyper reflexes, etc, etc...anyhow, this is my first pregnancy with a new father and I have been told that I have a higher chance of getting again. With those symptoms she said it is good to check. My blood pressure was fine-it was 126/72. That is high for me, but not according to high blood pressure standards. So my question now is, what do I do to deal with the swelling, hot and tingly feeling I have mainly in my feet but slightly in my hands, too? My shoes are tight and uncomfortable and my feet constantly tingle and feel hot and tight. This just came on in the past day or two. Any suggestions? Anyone else experiencing this so early? I can't even imagine how bad it's going to get during the summer months!!",
