            "answer": "Its really hard to tell, I hope for your sake that you do go into labor naturally just because its nicer than being induced... but its really hard to tell... At 37 weeks, I was 3 Cm dilated and somewhere between 80-90% effaced depending on who did the check......\u00a0\u00a0 Im still pregnant here at 39 weeks 4 days... its really annoying and im sure i didnt progress at all over the last week and i have been trying everything but castor oil...baby has been at station 0 for so long...\u00a0\u00a0I really hope that things move along for you between now and the 19th, you have time!!! and it would be so awesome if it just happens naturally. =)",

            "answer": "yeah i learned alot from making frequent trips to the hospital but i mean i was having real labor contractions because i went from 1 cm to 3 cm over night...\u00a0\u00a0but its so hard\u00a0\u00a0to tell..When i went in, I had been having contractions 3 minutes apart for 2 hours... because i was told to go to the hospital if they were coming regular and at lest every 5-7mins apart...\u00a0\u00a0so when they sent me home, i asked them when I would know to come back.. they said probably when the contractions are 3-5 mins apart.. and i was like but they aalready are.. so she said when they start to get more intense.. while they did get more intense, like extremely painful so i went back a 3rd time and found out there was no change.. these contractions continued for a while longer than died out..\u00a0\u00a0at that point, they told me to come back when something is different...\u00a0\u00a0they said it may sound unclear but it will make sense...\u00a0\u00a0She said the contractions will get really intense to the point where you cant think, talk, walk during them, will be coming quite frequently, and will not be dying down... Of course how long you have to wait to see I dont know because like i said both times before i went into the hospital, I was timing contractions for over 2 hours..for me, my contractions have stopped.. i still have some periodically but i think these ones are BH ones again because they dont form any pattern so I guess, maybe its true, ill know if i start gettng more intense contractions again that start coming regularly..As for the blood tinged mucous, it could be a bit of a bloody show/mucous plug.. or it could be from your check.. I had it both times after my checks at the hospital, mainly the next morning.\u00a0\u00a0It is a sign that things have been stirred up there...\u00a0\u00a0today when my doctor did my membrane sweep, when she took her glove out, it was coated in mucousy blood (tmi sorry)...\u00a0\u00a0the membrane sweep she did last week, that didnt happen.. She referred to it as a bloody show stillI believe the cramping is normal and can generally be related to the thinning of the cervix having the babys head move down causing more pressure..",

            "answer": "Okay, so you sound SO much like me!!\u00a0\u00a0I have been into L&D SO many times.\u00a0\u00a0Because I have preeclampsia, I have to go in there every 2-3 days to have my blood pressures monitored.\u00a0\u00a0And every time I've been in, I've been contracting.\u00a0\u00a0I'll have the regular patterns where they come every 2 minutes and last a minute.\u00a0\u00a0I'll labor like that for an hour, then it will let up (and I hadn't been having any changes) so they'll send me home.\u00a0\u00a0But, like you, when I ask when to come back (contraction-wise) they'll say \"When they're close together - coming every two mins apart and lasting for a minute or more.\"\u00a0\u00a0I'm like, \"ummm ... that's what's happening right now!\"\u00a0\u00a0She did mention the \"when you can't walk or talk through them and they take your breath away.\"\u00a0\u00a0But when I'm at home and contracting, and they're coming that close together, that's what already happens!\u00a0\u00a0So ... sigh ... I just don't know!I was wondering if the bloody mucus this morning could have been from being checked too.\u00a0\u00a0But I'd been checked about 4 times before and never got the blood.\u00a0\u00a0But maybe it's because this time I was actually dilated and effaced??Hmm ... who knows?!!You and I might be having babies at the same time, it sounds like! :)",

            "answer": "At least pretty close together..What i found with my checks is that they have gotten more uncomfortable the more I am dilated.. When I got checked when I was having preterm labor issues back at 32 weeks and was closed, almost no discomfort... then at 1cm a little more.. but then when i was 3 cm, it was ike holy ****.. that is a bit more intense...\u00a0\u00a0I also thought the same thing I had never spotted before after being checked but liek you that was before i was dilated.. My doctor says once oyu dilate and efface, your cervix is alot softer and more sensitive... so thats probably why..\u00a0\u00a0though when I was checked the 2nd time at the hospital when I was still only 3 cm after the very painful intense contractions, i didnt spot that time....",
