            "answer": "i hope you feel better soon.. i don't know much about the symptoms of hbp, but i agree with kylesmom09, that you should push for a visit. if your instincts are telling you that you need to get checked out, don't back down no matter how much they try to reassure you. even our doctor's can miss obvious or important things sometimes. i am sure all will be fine, and you sound to be very in-tune with your body, so i know you will do what is best for you and your baby. please keep us updated <3",

            "answer": "Well I went to doc appointment yesterday and my bp was 187/90 and I have a 12lb weight gain since the 11th so they sent me over to the hospital for NIH monitoring. After monitoring and blood work it was determined that I am not preeclamptic but it is something we have to watch out for. Doc said he is unsure as to why my bp is spiking but says to stay off my feet cuz walking raises your bp and if it spikes to lay down on my left side to help bring it down.So the next few weeks I get to try to take it easy but with daddy getting a new job driving OTR and being gone for week at a time I am left to take care of the house, our two boys, and our dog.....take it easy sounds very hard from where I'm sitting at the moment.\u00a0\u00a0 =(",

    "question": "So last Thursday I get a headache and it wouldnt go away. Friday I started swelling, had headache, was dizzy and felt overall like crap. Saturday and Sunday were the same and I had even called the OB on Friday only for them not to be too concerned. According to my scale I had put on literally 10lbs in 2 days. So finally I get up today..headache gone and swelling disappeared as well and my weight is back down. My cuz thinks I may have had an elevated blood pressure and that is bad cuz it could lead to preeclampsia. So my questions are..when do I start to worry if my doc's office didnt seem too worried about it and should I push for a doc visit to check next time (*hoping their is not a next time*)?Also...they called my in Lorecet 7.5 to help with the headache but I refuse to take them since I am pregnant and those are narcotics. I cant believe they would prescribe those to an expectant mother!",
