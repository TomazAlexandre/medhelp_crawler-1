            "answer": "First, I'm sorry to hear you're going through so much stress at this point in your pregnancy. You should definitely talk to your doctor about how you're feeling. If they have you at 36 weeks then I don't think there's anything you can do to be induced at this point. Depending on where you are the doctor may not be able to even if they thought your reasons were good. I know where I live doctors arent allowed to induce before 39 weeks unless you or the baby are in physical distress. That isn't\u00a0\u00a0true everywhere\u00a0\u00a0though. Still it can be harmful to both you and your baby to induce too early. And personally I don't agree with inducing for any reason other than medical necessity because it puts the two of you at risk which will definitely cause you even more physical, emotional, and financial trouble. However, I do understand that you are in a very tough situation for various reasons and I can sympathize with you. So all I can say is talk to your doctor about all of the things that you stated here. If you've been on bed rest and having contractions like that then you may be close already. And your doctor can at least discuss what your options are realistically. And maybe give you some tips on speeding things up naturally. I\u00a0\u00a0hope it comes for you soon.",

            "answer": "I am having to wait it out, I am 41 weeks. I want natural birth at a birthing center and I have done everything to go into labor. I am measuring three weeks ahead and ultrasound shows baby at 9 1/2 pounds. My midwife said the Dr would agree to induce me at the hospital if I wanted because of baby size and I said no because I do not want to have baby at hospital. He will let me continue with pregnancy as long as baby and I are not in danger. I am now getting weekly ultrasound and nst to keep an eye on baby. I am going to start to get more aggressive with self induction I will up my epo to the max, bounce clean and walk all day, I am having sex everyday and will increase it to three times daily, my daughter is still nursing and I will start to pump between feedings and a last resort I will take castor oil.I hope your Dr will agree to induce you. I was induced early with three of my children and one as early as 37 weeks. Pregnancy is rough for many once you almost get to term and with a healthy baby that would be fine delivered they should take your choice into account. Everyone thinks that the longer baby is in is better but that is not the case. Some babies get to large when left to come on their own some pass stool when they are left in too long. There is no real way to know if your baby is ready and getting baby to come early is risky when you are 36-37 weeks and you should have a ultrasound to check baby for signs of being ready.My advise buff up your reasons for being induced. I know you can come up with more logical reasons to be induced that your Dr could not argue with. If Dr can not argue then you will normally get your way. Good luck mama I really do understand your discomfort and wishes to put a end to the suffering. I hope things work out.",

    "question": "I'm physically, emotionally and financially exhausted...For arguments sake here are my reasons to wanting to be done.Physically, this has been a rough pregnancy!! It's not my first and I understand its not meant to be this easy beautiful thing... I've lost a ton of weight, had a month in my second trimester where things got better.... Then the contractions started along with the trips to the hospital to stop them but the meds they gave me never made them go away for more than an hour. These aren't cute little things they are true painful contractions that I've had for over a month. Physically I can't sleep out of being uncomfortable and contractions waking me up.Emotionally after dealing with the contractions, let's back up.... Emotionally we're all Ready to be done at this point but adding contractions and the stress that goes along with my situation.....Which brings up financially... I work full time and left a month before I planned to for my maternity leave due to bed rest, I didn't want a preemie so I didn't argue... The stress of that alone is tough, each day he isn't here is a day I don't get with my baby.How far along am I? 37 weeks according to my last menstrual period, my doctor says 36 weeks.Other reasons? I had preeclampsia with my first and only other child. He was 9.3lbs 21 1/2\" at birth, a big, big baby... Which caused a significant amount of blood loss to myself (40%), I was in the hospital for two weeks after he was born, it was miserable!!If you don't agree with me fine but if you do I'd love your input because it's way more than being tired of being pregnant, I'm worried about my energy level and what the stress of the situation and to my body is doing especially when it's actually time to push and go into labor.Sorry it's so long....",
