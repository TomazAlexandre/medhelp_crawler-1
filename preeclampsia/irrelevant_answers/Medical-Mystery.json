            "answer": "Sounds like heart palpitations. Which are normal during pregnancy. Though some cases may be light others can be like yours where its hard to breathe and all that. I went to the ER too cus My heart was racing and it kinda scared me cus it happened for 3 days straight. They did an ekg and all that (not to the extent of what you had) but everything was fine. Was told that as baby grows our imsides become squished, including out hearts which causes them to speed up and sometimes that can cause you to loose breath and whatnot. Thats just my uneducated guess though.",

Maybe try that next time it happens and see if that helps. My sister had similar problems and the baby almost wedged herself under a rib.",

They didn't do an ultrasound last night. I breathe ok in just about any position.\u00a0\u00a0The nature of how suddenly and severely respiratory distress occurs is unusual. At 28 weeks, with him being about 2.5 lbs, I thought he was a little too small at this stage to get wedged any where. But maybe it is possible he's kicking something strong enough to cause problems.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your consideration. And no they didn't do a CT probably because I've had no chest pain, anxiety, faintness, clammy skin, cyanosis, or cough. Just a strong drive to breathe hard and rapidly. Plus my vitals have remained normal and these episodes are so random. I have had a respiratory event for about 8 hours now. The episode before that one had been 10 hours. Before that 6 hours at the time I was in the hospital experiencing several episodes. But I will bring up a discussion about PEs with my midwife tomorrow. As well as the possibility of baby kicking heart or lungs causing theze events. Even though he is still fairly small and it can occur while I'm standing... hhmmm",

I see you don't feel anxious per se, but anxiety can take on physiological symptoms, and if they can't find anything obviously wrong maybe it's worth thinking about. Your shortness of breath also reminds me of asthma. My mom had bad asthma when carrying my sister that went away after the birth. Just a couple thoughts! :) good luck!",

            "answer": "So I solved my mystery. During my breathing crises, I had too much fluid leave my veins and seep into my tissues. This put extra strain on my heart. Also I'm sure I had a touch of pulmonary edema too small to be picked up by xray but enough that I could feel the difference in my lungs. With diluted blood circulating in my lungs, I had less oxygen carrying capacity. I'm short and baby pushes on my diaphragm and lungs. So those 4 things combined I'm sure were the cause of my respiratory exacerbation. To avoid this, I have to stay hydrated, elevate my legs often but not in a way that restricts my breathing, and wear compression socks.\u00a0\u00a0:/Oh well, 2 weeks to go.",

    "question": "So I've been having an issue that the OBs and my midwives can't figure out. Any anecdotal bits of information may help! Here's my background information. I'm 29, 28.5 weeks pregnant, first pregnancy, no miscarriages. I'm a nonsmoker, rare drinker, never any cardiac or respiratory problems, no asthma, no medical history at all.Baby boy is on target developmentally, kicks a lot, and I'm not having any contractions.From 13-14 weeks I've had a bit of shortness of breath. Very mild and only here and there. But since then it has steadily increased in frequency and strength of respirations. I've increased my nutritional iron intake and I'm taking 50 mg of iron supplement.I've been steadily gaining a lot of edema. It's in my arms and up to the middle of my back. My midwives sent me to get an echocardiogram and it was fine. They also drew labs and checked urine. All were fine. No signs of preeclampsia or any other known abnormal condition.24 hours ago I started gasping dramatically breathing at a rate of 40 breaths per minute. This lasted about a minute. I was sitting down at the time with my feet on a foot stool. This occurred a few more times lasting 30 seconds to a couple minutes seemingly not precipitated by ambient temperature, mood level, exertion, rest, or hydration level. My midwife sent me to the hospital. They put me on the monitor and watched my oxygen levels, heart rate, CO2 levels, baby's heart rate, intermittent blood pressures. All my vital signs were within normal limits. I had about 6 more of these episodes while lying down at rest completely randomly within the first 2 hours I was there. Then nothing for 4-5 hours. The only change in my vitals at this time was an increase in heart rate from 80s to 100s-120s and then return to normal. Chest xray, EKG, urine, venous blood work, arterial blood work, lung capacity and lung sounds all normal. They said they couldn't figure out what was wrong. They sent me home with a 24 hour cardiac halter monitor. I walked down to the cardiology clinic from the L&D unit. While standing in line I had another episode. Then at home on the monitor I was putting away the dishes and I had another episode. I cant seem to slow the respirations or will my body to relax when this happens. The halter monitor only picks up abnormal electric activity. One can still have cardiac and respiratory issues and it can't be diagnosed with a halter monitor. So........ any ideas as to what is wrong with me????? Any tidbit??",
