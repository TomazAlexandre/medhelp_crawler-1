            "answer": "Thanks so much for the reply.I have been to another doctor who is trying a few things before doing a liver biopsy since there are so many risks with performing this task.One of them has been to cut down to 800 calories a day with excercise. He would like me to lose 30lbs in the next couple of months which I find scary but I guess it's the doctor's orders so it must be needed. He wants me to lose weight and then retest my liver enzymes to see if that's the case.Lately, I have very little faith in doctors but we'll see how this works out.",

    "question": "Hi,I am in need of some information. I have seen doctors and specialists and all are coming up with something different. My last appt, my gastro looked at me (I'm overweight) and said that I probably have fatty liver but decided to order an ultrasound along with some blood work. I will provide you with some background on abnormal test results from my recent last 2 visits:Alkaline Phosphatas 111GFR >60Iron 19TIBC 484Iron Saturation 4%Hemoglobin 10.4Hematocrit 32.8MCV 67.2MCH 21.3RDW 20.8RDW:Moderate AnisocytosisModerate MicrocytosisModerate PolychromasisSlight Target CellsAlso, all of my Liver Enzymes are all elevated. Heps and auto-immune came back negative.My Radiologist letter from the doctor states that the findings were limited due to body habitus but here are the findings:There was a slight increased liver echotexture may be due to hepatocellular disease, including steatosis.Borderline spleen size (12.7cm) indicates portal venous hypertension, amongst other causes. Please clincally correlate.A hypoechoic structure seen near the porta hepatis could represent a small lymph node.My doctor just did a gastroscopy and found that I have asophogus inflammation. I asked about my ultrasound results and he looked confused when I questioned the letter and said that I have fatty liver disease, he doesn't know anything about what letter I was talking about.Please help. Should I be demanding more tests incase this is more serious, is there something else that I may have? My symptoms all correlate with fatty liver (hair loss, headaches, stomach pain, mood changes, forgetfullness, fatique, trouble waking up, lower back pain) but the letter concerned me. Any help or suggestions is really appreciated. Thanks.P.S. On another note, I'm not sure if any of this relates but in the last year and a half I have had:Preeclampsia, Pregnancy Induced Hypertension, C-Section, Pancreatitis, Gallstones, Gall Bladder extraction, I retained my placenta for half a year and had a D&C, Bacterial vaginosis, urinary tract infections, gastroternitis x2, H. Pylori x2, Insulin Resistance post-pregnancy, Severe anemia post-pregnancy",
