    "question": "On Sept 10th at 11am I was sent to labor and delivery by my Dr do to my blood pressure being a little high. While in labor and delivery they ran test to see if I had preeclampsia which came back negative. They check my cervix and I was 4cm dilated and 25% effaced and that's where I stayed for the whole 4 hours even after walking around the hospital. I was sent home around 4:30 pm upset and uncomfortable. So I decided to take evening primrose oil to help me at least get to 5 or 6 cm. At 9pm I inserted 3 into my vagina and took one by mouth. At 11:45pm my water broke. Went back to labor and delivery and I was at 5cm and 75% effaced went through a hour of strong contractions before receiving an epidural that worked wonders lol.. at 6:55am the dr came in to check me again I was 10cm and ready to push at 7:21am on 9/11 my baby girl was born. On the anniversary of a tragic day for our country i received the most precious gift I'm so blessed. Good luck ladies on your journey of motherhood and be blessed\u263a",
