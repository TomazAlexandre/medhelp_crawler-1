            "answer": "I actually know a girl who had developed pre eclampsia in the final few days but didnt know as her BP was fine! I would definately get a second opinion because it sounds like it but if it comes up clear all you can do is try relieve symptoms ie try lying on your side with feet and hands higher than your heart, this will relieve pressure in your main vein in your spine which could be giving you visual disturbances, it will also help with the swelling . try drinking a few extra glasses of water throughout the day to help keep hydrated in case it is something as simple as that",

    "question": "Hi ladies, I'm 39 weeks & 3 days today and since last week i started feeling headaches, dizziness, nausea, abdominal pain, and black starry dots in my vision. I really didn't think much of it and the vision problem ive had weeks with that so i thought it was normal. So last Thursday my BP was higher than normal it was 135/88 in my regular check so my OB asked if I've i had any headaches lately and well i said yes actually with dizziness. So she seemed concerned and starting asking me other questions and she suspected i had preeclampsia. So i did a 24hr urine test and im supposed to get the results this coming Friday November 1st, my due date lol. But anyways the symptoms are just getting worse because i developed sudden hand swelling and that never happened before throughout this whole pregnancy. So im really concerned now so i decide to go to the ER. I get\u00a0\u00a0and monitored and everything is normal, normal blood pressure, no protein in my urine no nothing! They tell me the headaches are tension headaches and all the rest of the symptoms are normal. Like what the heck!? Seriously!?? Then why are my symptoms still the same and the swelling is progressing :\\ now both of my arms are swollen, my left hand just my fingers and my right just my forearm. What the heck is going on with me?? Is all of this actually normal? Please HELP! :( and my baby is no were near coming :\\ i was told i was 1cm dilated and in the ER they tell me im not even 1cm I'm barely like a fingertip. I'm not sure about nothing no more, maybe they were wrong in the ER because the doctor was a bit mean and rough, she might have not checked right. Ughh just please help anybody, I'm going crazy just wondering! :(",
