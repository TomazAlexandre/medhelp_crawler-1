            "answer": "YIKES Im sorry :( Thats so early! How is your blood pressure? You have protien in urine? Or they are checking you due to rapid weight gain? Thank God I got it after 37 wks because the chances of getting it Earlier are slim. If I had gotten it at 35 wk then this time i couldve gotten it at 30 wk.... Its scary and something we have no control over :(",

Ive been having pains up high in stomach recently too and thats another sign but its something else i thought was normal and didnt mention either. I'm 29 weeks and 1 day. it is scary and i posted on here yesterday looking for advice or help or something and no one had anything to say on the subject :( sad",

            "answer": "AWE- Well, I started getting protien in urine around 7-8months, and then when i came in for a checkup at 36 wks, my BP was elevated, not by much though and also had the protien. The next visit around 37-38 wks I went in for another check up and my BP was even more elevated...... ALSO I had SEVERE swelling.... 40 lb came off of me 2 wks Post-Birth.Ill tell you it is scary, It isnt \"treatable\", you will be in and out of hospital.... They probably will give you the steroid for bubs lungs to mature..... All of this *IF* you do indeed have protien in urine, HBP AND swelling.I hope the BP gets to a normal range for you... Hopefully your little one can cook for at least 4 more wks.... If preeclampsia becomes uncontrolable they WILL deliver, regardless of how far along you are...It is very scary, but please prepare yourself for it too.. I believe preeclampsia is one of the most difficult things to do with pregnancy.",
