    "question": "I know this may sound ridiculous because this is my 3rd baby, but I am actually really nervous about giving birth this time around. I've had vaginal deliveries both times, to a 10lb. & 3lb. 9oz. baby. My oldest was right on time but I had gestational diabetes that wasn't caught until later in my pregnancy but his labor wasn't too bad considering it's still labor. My second son was induced at 31.6 weeks due to me having severe preeclampsia. I think his labor has somewhat traumatized me due to all things that I had to have done within the week I had to stay in the hospital. Am I being silly or does anyone else feel a little nervous about giving birth?",
