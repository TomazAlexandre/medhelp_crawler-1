            "answer": "It's water retention. Watch your sodium intake. I had the same issue and delivered my son exactly the same 35 weeks 6days due to preeclampsia. This time I had it early on and started taking a powder form of magnesium and liquid fish oils since then my blood pressure has been great and no more protein in my urine!! :-) I also severely limit my sodium and don't eat much processed food.",

    "question": "This is my second pregnancy. I delivered my first because of preeclampsia at 35 weeks 6 days. I gained 14lbs my whole first pregnancy. For my second pregnancy I have appointments twice a week to monitor my blood pressure since it has been up and down the whole time. Between my appointment on Monday and the following appointment three days later on Thursday I have gained 5 lbs. My total weight gain for this pregnancy is now 15 lbs and I will be 35 weeks on Sunday. Does the 5lbs in three days not seem a bit excessive? Also, baby is measuring over a week ahead.",
