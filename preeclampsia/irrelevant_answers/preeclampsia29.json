            "answer": "I had preclampsia with my first. If it comes back positive you will go to the hospital most likely because they will need to monitor you. You may have to have a c-section after that but as long as they are monitoring you you should be fine. They will take care of you. Its scary I know. The first time I was by myself and so scared but you will be fine. Try not to stress that just makes your blood pressure go up. Keep us posted",
