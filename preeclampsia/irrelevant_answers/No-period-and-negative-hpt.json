I was freaked out because Im not ready for kids right now and when i got my results from my blood test it was a major relife when i was told it was negative. Go see you doctor and ask for a blood test because from what i learned HPT arnt always accurate. Getting the blood test will take that off your chest n they are more accurate (in my opinion) then a HPT.",

    "question": "Hi. My last menstrual cycle was March 3rd. I was due to start my next one on the 5th and so far nothing. Only signs I've had are light abdominal cramping, tired, headaches, and some nausea. I gave birth to my daughter over 6 months ago and I am breastfeeding. But since 7 weeks post baby I've had my period on time every month till now. I've taken 3 different test all came back negative. I'm really confused as to what could be going on. Only time I've missed a period is when I had my daughter. I don't know if I may be pregnant and should go in for a blood test or what. We aren't trying for another baby and we prefer not to have a baby right now due me having preeclampsia with my last pregnancy and needing to have the leep procedure done soon.. Anyone have any idea what could be going on since all HPT are negative? Is there a chance I may still be pregnant even with negative hpt's?",
