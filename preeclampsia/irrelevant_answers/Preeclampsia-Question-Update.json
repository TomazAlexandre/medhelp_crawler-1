Sorry, I forgot if you said before.Spend as much time as you can laying on your side and resting.\u00a0\u00a0I would be a good idea to get a home blood pressure monitor (you can pick these up at any drug store probably for around $25-30) and take it a couple times every day during a quiet time at home.There are some blood tests that are commonly done to gauge whether or not you are developing pre-eclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0I surprised this isn't being done.",

The specialist I saw said that there was a problem with the vascularization of the placenta, and so the uterinplacenta blood flow is not good, which is creating the high blood pressure. So, when I got to my doctor after seeing the specialist, my doctor said that it was preexisting hypertension. He has been acting like that specialist didn't find a problem with the placenta and is convinved that I had high blood pressure before....Which is NOT true and I tried telling him that, but he seems to think he has it all figured out! So I have NO idea what to do. I think I am going ask to be refered to the specialist in Toledo for the remainder of my pregnancy so that i know that someone is paying attention!",

Him being like this to you has ME freaking out about you and me both!\u00a0\u00a0When I ever have my next one, I am going to get into this Dr. Walker.

    "question": "I went to the doctor today. All of my blood pressures for the last week have been about 140/90 or just over. My WONDERFUL doctor told me my blood pressure was fine, and he would see me in a week! Thats all he said! He didn't even ask me about the swelling at all, but I had told the nurse before he came in! He is seriously starting to scare me because he has so many patients, I don't think he remembers who anyone is....so of course, he probably forgets how high risk I am, and how the specialist I saw told me to be very cautious of every symptom. I am so stressed out by this whole situation! But thanks to all that gave advice on preeclampsia.",
