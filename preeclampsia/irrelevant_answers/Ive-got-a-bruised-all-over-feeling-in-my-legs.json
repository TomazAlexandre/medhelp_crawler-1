    "question": "I just gave birth to my son on the 20th of October... I had preeclampsia and was admitted to the hospital a week before actually being induced and delivering because of my blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Blood pressure before labor was running 165/90 and during labor it was running 185/110.\u00a0\u00a0They gave me Magnesium Sulfate for the blood pressure, and an antibiotic as I was positive for the Group B Strep.Here lately I've been taking a blood pressure and water pill for my swelling and elevated blood pressure (been like 150/80).\u00a0\u00a0I was also taking an antibiotic for a UTI caused by the catheter that was inserted during labor and delivery.\u00a0\u00a0I was told the Magnesium Sulfate weakens your muscles in the bladder and they want to make sure I was going like I was suppose to.Anyways I've been getting this bruised all over feeling in my legs.\u00a0\u00a0If I push on a part of my leg it feels like I have a bruise there although there is no bruise present... is this a cause for concern?\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if it's the meds or what...",
