    "question": "On sept 16 i woke up with blood on my under wear and alot of cramps, I contacted my Dr right away and she said to time my contractions . By 4:30pm they were closer together but irregular and i was still spotting (brown and light pink discharge) so i called my Dr to let her know i was still spotting the nurse told me not to go in unless my contractions were 5 minuts apart 1 minute long for an hour. At that's\u00a0\u00a0point i was in ao much pain i didn't know what to do!!! My sister in law told me go to the l&d now i ended up going at 5:20pm, they admitted me even tho i was only 1cm dilated but my contractions were 2 minutes apart they were planning on inducing me and then we found out i had preeclampsia my BP was over the roof. So they couldn't induce me because Iwould of had a seizure. So they decises to do an emergency C-section i was like thank God finally decition. Right before i was foing into the OR my water broke so they checked me once again and i was still 1 cm dilated after 6 hours. I ended up having a Csection. My baby was born at 1:21 am on sept 17 and he weight 7lbs 2 oz. 19 inches long. My due date was sept 24 according to my LMP and sept 17 according to my ultrasound. But i am so happy he is a healthy beautiful baby. And my blood preasure is still high so i will be here at the hospital for a week. Good lick to the rest of you ladies it qas not easy but it was all worth it! Trust me ;)",
