When i spoke to the nurse she wanted me to come right in of course because Spade was right...it can be a complication of preeclampsia! So, we went right in and they tested my blood pressure first and it was a little high but not too bad like it was (the bed rest must have helped some for that) and they did find some protein in my urine..but not much so they decided to do a blood test to see how my liver was functioning because they were worried about the rib pain....Luckily all my blood tests came back perfectly normal and the babies NST strip passed with flying colors! Im going back to the doctors today with my 24 hour urine jug and theyre gonna do another NST (twice a week actually) and keep a really close eye on my blood pressure (also twice a week) just in case but so far it looks like a very mild manageable case of preeclampsia.But i have to say a big THANK YOU to spade22 because the doctors said even though they didnt find any huge issues it was definitely good that i came to get checked out...because it could have meant life or death for us!I hope that someone will just talk to me about an induction today at my appointment so i can just stop worrying every 2 seconds if the preeclampsia is progressing or not because its seriously freaking me out! i mean i know its best to go natural but i just dont want to deal with this anymore! i want my baby safe on the outside where i can hug and kiss him!and last but not least, ALL of you ladies are Fantastic...thank you for caring so much!",

Turns out that i do have less amniotic fluid then i did during my last ultrasound but its still well within the normal range (they said i still have a couple good\u00a0\u00a0pockets around him) so that was good! But she didnt talk about an induction as of yet because things are staying in the \"safe zone\" but that im too much on the border line of preeclampsia to let me off of bed rest...so im still chained to the bed as of yet...but she did say i could lay on the couch if i wanted to LOL yay *rolls eyes* ...she wont even let me go to the\u00a0\u00a0dang grocery store!!Im just so frusterated because theyre all happy i made it to full term and are saying he can come when he wants now but i dont see how thats ever gonna happen if they make me stay in bed!! its so annoying to because i feel pretty normal...i know its important for mine and babies health but im just SO tired of this!",
