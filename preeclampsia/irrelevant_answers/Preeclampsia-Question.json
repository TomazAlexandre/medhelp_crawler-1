            "answer": "I have the same issue with swelling, most of my swelling occurs in my left leg, ankle, and foot. My blood pressure has been around 130/90 for the past 3 weeks so I have to go see my docter weekly to moniter swelling and blood pressure. I'm 35 weeks and I work 6 days a week 8 hour days in a factory so generally the temperatures inside the building are 100+ degrees. I have been considering asking the docter to restrict me to less hours because I am miserable almost every day. They docter tells me the swelling is normal and so far my blood pressure hasn't been too extremely high so they don't make too big of a deal Over it. They just tell me to call if I start feeling unwell or develop a really bad headache because those are signs that your blood pressure is really high.",

I kept telling my ob something was wrong my entire pregnancy it was a nightmare. No one listened and finally I went to the ER and they admitted me that night and rushed me to another hospital the next day to deliver. Scariest experience of my life and it all happened in Germany where no one spoke very good English!",

    "question": "Ok. each time I go to the doctor, my Bp is 120/74 or 124/74. Well I'm now 7 months and have been having bubbles in my urine. Like a patch here or there. my feet have been swelling due to either it being extremely hot outside or the fact that I work 4 days a week standing at least 7 hours.(which bothers me because I have 3 off days and have time to sit!) and each time that I lay down, my feet will go down slightly.. but as soon as I start back walking, they swell right back up...and my ankles and top of my feet are tight....the next time I go to the doctor will be on June the 22nd and I should be 30 weeks. Are the bubbles in urine, swelling ankles and feet constantly normal during the third trimester? Or should I be concerned?",
