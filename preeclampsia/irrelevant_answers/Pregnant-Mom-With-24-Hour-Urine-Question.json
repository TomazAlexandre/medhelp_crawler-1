            "answer": "Blood tests looking at the kidney funtion is reasonable, and reported to be normal.I would consider some imaging studies - such as an ultrasound or IVP - to determine if there is a structural lesion leading to the protein.Other diseases like diabetes or congestive heart failure should be evaluated for.\u00a0\u00a0A fasting sugar test can evaluate the former.\u00a0\u00a0The latter disease is less likely with the normal echo.The most definitive test would be a kidney biopsy - however, this is normally considered if the protein is consistently above 2 grams.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.
