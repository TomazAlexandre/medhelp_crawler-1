FYI: I joined this forum in addition to Jan09 since Im pretty sure everyone on the Jan09 forum had their babies!The tech today said the u/s showed Sophia measuring as she should be for 39.4 weeks and she looks good!\u00a0\u00a0The OB thought she might be around 9lbs or so and wanted to have her weight checked.\u00a0\u00a0I should hopefully get the ordering OB's impression by the end of this week. My next office visit is on Monday.\u00a0\u00a0Im keeping my fingers and toes crossed that induction gets put on the table before I reach 42 weeks!!!!As far as I am feeling these days..just feel so heavy and at times, lots of pressure in my pelvis and this baby really pushes on my bladder at times which is very painful.\u00a0\u00a0Sleeping well...what's that??!?!?!? HA!",

This daughter of mine, Sarah, is putting a lot of pressure on my cervix and bladder..and it quite uncomfortable. ....I asked my office how far they will let someone go it they go overdue and she told me 41 weeks....So i hope they dont let you reach 42 weeks! You poor thing. I just dont want to give birth to a HUGE baby..that is my fear. I want to be able to have natural birth...no c section..but what happens..happens i guess.I am def hoping to hear that they decide to induce...so I am anxiously awaiting even fridays appt..... I dont think I have lost my mucus plug yet..I have definetely had more discharge..but no plug yet...atleast I havent seen it!Stephanie",

            "answer": "Hey ladies!Feeling great this week....having sex and eating tons of pineapples here. And maybe it's working cuz at my doctor's appointment Monday they told me I am 2 cm. dilated and 80% effaced. That was exciting, because I haven't felt like anything has been happening!I think I lost my mucous plug yesterday, and I have been feeling crampy since Monday, but I know all of that doesn't mean a lot, I could probably still go another week or two from what I have read. Sunday is my due date, and I'd rather go 42 weeks before being induced, as long as we're healthy, so we'll see what happens. I heard from a couple of friends about a famous restaurant near here, Scalinis; they have a recipe, eggplant parmesan, that has supposedly put over 300 women into labor. Here's an article about it, with the recipe, which I am planning to make this weekend:http://www.wchstv.com/gmarecipes/eggplantparmigian.shtmlOh, one thing at my appointment did have me a little worried....the midwife detected a faint murmur when she listened to the heartbeat this time. She said it is fairly common, and most of the time it goes away after delivery, and that if there were a serious heart defect, they probably would have detected it on the 20 week ultrasound, which was clean. Has anyone else experienced this?I'm trying to make myself savor the last few weeks here...I wonder, will there be a part of me that misses feeling baby's movements after she arrives? I am really looking forward to having my body to myself again, but it seems like I will feel sort of empty inside too...",

            "answer": "Thanks for making this post Lance! I was totally going to do it yesterday and I got caught up with a few other things. Well I'm still HERE and still Pregnant!I constantly have to remind myself that my original due date was February 5th...so I guess I still have another week before I can really complain...but I just thought I would have had him by now!No major changes...still getting that Crampy feeling everyday and BH Contractions. Last night I was getting them more often. They didn't seem to be getting stronger just more frequent. And the past couple days I have been getting a horrible headache which hasn't happened my entire pregnancy...so it makes me think my time is near! Caiden has been so active too, he doesn't seem to stop moving! I am constantly feeling his head twist and turn in my pelvis and he moves his but, arms and legs around constantly. I can feel everything! He is so low, all the pressure on my pelvis makes my belly feel so heavy. It's getting more painful to turn over at night and get up and down off the couch or bed.I had thought I lost some of my mucous plug a couple weeks ago but I think it was just from my internal that day because I haven't seen anything since. I've been having SO MUCH discharge though...its really nasty. I also thought my water broke last night...when I was peeing, all of a sudden it started coming out stronger and faster. But than I felt nothing, no contractions, nada. So I just figured I had to pee real bad! And speaking of, I am with you ladies...he is sitting or pushing on my bladder all the time! I think I peed 4 times in one hour yesterday! It kills, on top of all the other pressure I'm feeling. So I'm still sleeping great, but I get up like 5 times to pee cuz its so uncomfortable if I try and hold it in.So we just wait! My next appointment is Friday, so hopefully they'll tell me something. I've been 1+cm dilated for over 2 weeks now so I dunno. They said they will induce me on the 12th if I don't have him by then. Thats a week over my original due date. Like Lance I want to go natural here so I am also afraid if he bakes in there too long he's going to be too big for me to deliver. So I'm hoping he comes very soon! Were supposed to get a bad snow storm today, so watch today will be the day! ha ha.Yea sex isn't happening! We've been trying and its just so uncomfortable! My stomach always balls up and gets so tight that it hurts and I can't enjoy any of it. My poor hubby!Well sounds like we are all in similar boats here! Wanting our babies to be born soon and healthy! I think I will miss being pregnant and feeling him kick and move around inside me...but I know this isnt my last pregnancy and not only can I not wait to hold my son but I cant wait to get my body back!! Hang in there girls, one of us is next! It's so exciting that little by little were all starting to have our babies!! :)",

I seriously wake up everyday, eat and just wait for something to happen! LOL.I kinda wish I was still working but since we moved when I was 6 months Pregnant, by the time we got settled I was 7 months and of course no one is going to hire a 7 month preggo. So I feel like I've been out of work so long and now that were settled in our new home I am bored outta my mind!

Ha Ha.Same as you...I putts around and do the dishes, vacuum, wash the floors, bake, do laundry, clean up and play with our cats. But they are super lazy too and just sleep all day! We are caught up on laundry and we wash everything of Caidens as soon as we get it and his room has been done for a while so there's nothing left there to do!

    "question": "I know Gina normally posts this, but it looks like our last weekly check in was over a week ago, so I figured I would post just incase little Caiden decided to join the world and she wont be on! That would be pretty cool?!!So, how is everyone feeling? At this point, some of us already have our little one's in our arms...and many of us are very anxiously awaiting to see when ours will come!! Update everyone ladies...and let us know how you are doing!!!For me....I am sick of the tests...sick of the NST tests 2-3 times a week...sick of the bloodwork every week...and all of the damn appts, 2x a week, sometimes more. Im really mad that they mentioned induction to me for next week..and then having another one of the doctors say no....I was diagnosed with minor preeclampsia.....and thats why they were going to induce...so the midwife that told me we should induce is going to talk to the office to see if we can still induce next week like she thinks we should. I have a doctors appointment on Friday and I am hoping to have more information on whether it will happen or not!! I just want to know already. Besides that, DH and I are actively trying to get this baby out ourselves...having sex and such..even though its so uncomfortable....this may be a little TMI but the worst is when I get a BH contraction and my stomach balls all up.....in the middle of it..makes it quite uncomfortable because its like he cant even put any pressure on me....and all he says is...maybe we shouldnt be doing this. I assure him that its okay and its not going to hurt anything.They did an internal at the hospital yesterday and no change. She says I am still the same, about 1+ and 80% so nothing is happening. SHe also says that when touched the baby's head moves...so does that mean she can actually feel the babys head??? Weird.Anyways, how is everyone else doing???",
