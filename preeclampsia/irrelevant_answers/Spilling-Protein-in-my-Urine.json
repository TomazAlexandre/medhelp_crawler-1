            "answer": "Yeah I'm not too worried about it cuz my blood pressure has always been good.My sugar levels are good.I only have a very tiny bit of protein in my urine and I did the same thing with my last pregnancy and I never had a problem.I think mine just might be related to having really big babies cuz my mom said she always had a tiny bit in her urine too with all of us kids.I guess we'll just wait n see.She asked if I got alot of headaches, and I do, but that can also be due to 2 things-I have a problem with the nerves in the back of my eyes that are causing them to twist- and although I never got headaches before, the eye doc always asked me if I go headaches.I'm supposed to be seeing an eye doc once a month and I haven't seen one in over a year now cuz my insurance doesn't cover eye care.So maybe my condition just worsened over time and is causing me to have headaches.I also never get enough sleep.I strain my eyes to see all the time cuz everything's always blurryish from being tired.I think that has alot ot do with my headaches.She also asked if I see spots n stuff.I see these rainbow-ish little squiggly lights randomly here n there once in a while.But that could also have something to do with my eye condition cuz that's happened to me before I ever got pregnant.I dunno.I'm hoping everything is gunna be okay.",

My Dr. said I was dehydrated, but I cant recall if that was related to the protein or not.. Im not that helpful, but wanted to let you know I went through that, and all ended up a-ok for me..

    "question": "That's a 3D pic of Aiden.Well I went to the doc's today for a measurement ultrasound.I'm 32w4d and I'm measuring 34w2d.He's at an estimated 5lbs 3oz already and I am NOT happy about it.I'm doomed to ever having a \"Normal\" sized baby. And even though he's in the PERFECT position for a vbac, head down and facing my butt, I'm afraid he's just gunna be too big to deliver vaginally. Ugh.Just when I got my hopes up, I get it snatched away from me in a blink of an eye.Now my doc is saying I'm spilling a little bit of pretein in my urine, and I hadda get bloodwork done and she sent me home with a toilet hat, and a jug to collect my urine over a 24 hour period starting sunday morning into monday morning.She said something about checking me for hypertension or pre-eclampsia or something like that.Ugh.It's never ending people.I hate my life right about now.I wanna go strangle somebody.I think I'll start with hubby seeing he's the closest one to me.lololNow I gatta go to the docs once a week for ultrasounds and also be hooked up to the monitor for 10 minutes every time.I guess the only thing I'm happy about is I get to get an ultrasound every week.That's pretty cool I guess.",
