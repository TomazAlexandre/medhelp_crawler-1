They state that burning is not on their list of side effects, so I must have had an adverse effect to the drug.I have read lots of differing views on this drug, a very mixed bag of good bad and indifferent.There have been many cases of side effects causing death, and putting women in a vegetative state, because the midwife has not administered it correctly to the patient, and by people misreading what another midwife has written, when they change shifts for instance.I am trying to find out if what I felt was because this drug was not administered correctly, which I am pursuing with the NHS Tust at present.Also my veins at the site of the injection raised up when they gave me this drug, as my partner witnessed.I just need to know why they did not check anything at all, given that they did not check my reflexes etc after these reactions, especially if as they say, I should not have had these reactions per their list.The only lasting effects from this drug is how it has affected me mentally.I still can feel the burning sensation all over my body and the way that my heart was racing and I thought that I was about to have a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0This will stay in my brain for ever.",

            "answer": "I'll try one more time.It is unfortunate that the staff did not tell you in advance that you may feel a sensation of heat during administration.\u00a0\u00a0Even when administered properly, its my experience that the vast majority of women experience this.\u00a0\u00a0Some feel it much, much worse than others.\u00a0\u00a0We continue administering it anyway, although sometimes it is slowed down to try to minimize the effect a little.\u00a0\u00a0Often, slowing down the loading dose doesn't help, though.No reflexes need to be checked (although checking reflexes IS part of assessing a patient with pre-eclampsia as a baseline).\u00a0\u00a0The reason that reflexes are checked as a part of Mag sulfate administration, is that decreased reflexes are a sign of a build up of Mg to toxic levels in the bloodstream.\u00a0\u00a0However, it takes quite a long time to get to this point--hours, at least of continuous administration.\u00a0\u00a0Usually, Mg levels are drawn every 6 to 8 hours during administration.Mg sulfate can be QUITE irritating to the vein.\u00a0\u00a0Often, we put cold cloths over the vein site to minimize the pain during the loading dose and shortly thereafter.It should be quite easy to ask for a copy of your medical records and see what dose you were given.\u00a0\u00a0Usually, the load is 4 to 6 grams given over 20-30 minutes, followed by 2 grams an hour, to a max of 4 grams an hour.\u00a0\u00a0 This is the standard, usual dose given to everyone.I do not routinely warn any patient of possible cardiac effects.\u00a0\u00a0Generally, I have not often seen a patient complain of such effects, unless they become panicky about the burning (heat, flushing) sensation.\u00a0\u00a0If a patient has been on Mag sulfate for quite a while, they can complain of chest pressure and discomfort, in which case an EKG is done to be sure they are not suffering from myocardial ischemia.\u00a0\u00a0But this almost never happens unless the pt. has been on Mag for many, many, many hours and has an abnormally high Mag level.You are very lucky that you did not progress to develop eclampsia (the onset of seizures) after you did not receive an adequate administration of Magnesium.\u00a0\u00a0I have seen a few women seize with eclampsia, and in some cases their babies have died in utereo during the seizures.\u00a0\u00a0Most of the time, even untreated, pre-eclampsia will not progress to eclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0But unfortunately, we cannot predict who will or will not progress to this dreaded outcome.You were very fortunate.\u00a0\u00a0You are obsessing about something that is far in the past now.\u00a0\u00a0You have a healthy child.\u00a0\u00a0My advice is to stop obsessing about this and look towards a bright and happy future with your child.\u00a0\u00a0I doubt you will be successful in suing the NHS unless you can prove grave damages, and that you were given an improper dose of Magnesium.I wish you the best, and will have no furthur response for you.\u00a0\u00a0I've given it all I can, as an experienced labor nurse of 30 years who has administered this drug, and others, for many, many years to very high risk patients.Best of luck to you and your familiy.",

You know, you might have been uncomfortable, but THEN IT WAS OVER AND YOU AND YOUR SON ARE FINE.....meanwhile, there are women out there (like me) that battle issues that were pregnancy-birth related for a long period of time after the birth. My son has many delays and issues, but I don't sit here and ask people a million times if my hospital was negligent...I know they were...I have accepted it and moved on...knowing that there is nothing I can do to go back adn change how long it took for the doctor to finally do my c-section. Will I consult a lawyer? Potentially.....but not until I get a diagnosis of a birth related issue caused by lack of oxygen or something like that.....!!! I am not sitting here complaining about how the nurses ignored my pleas when I told them ashtyn's heart rate was low, or when I was told I had the wrong blood type, and other countless errors that occured!!!! So basically, the point of this whole rant is that your issues are over, they will not follow you forever, or for LONG periods of time after the birth. Just remember, now matter how bad you feel about your situation, someone else always has it worse....and even when I get depressed about my son's delays, I focus on the fact that at least he is here, and for the most part, he is healthy.",

Irritation at the iv site was there. It burned, but I have a high tolerance to pain and delivered both children without epidurals. Do I recommend that to everyone? No. Not everyone has the same feelings and tolerance. My entire body felt hot, sweaty. Some would say on fire, I leave it hot and sweaty. Personal perception of the experience.As I read your comments, I am honestly worried that you are in depression right now. You said that you have been in the past and it is highly likely that this stressful and surprising pregnancy has used up much of the seratonin in your brain. In fact, the state of depression can actually make your perception of pain/feelings highly intensified. That may be the reason that you felt this intense all over burning. It is necessary to have a balance of seratonin and epinephrine/norepinephrine in your body for all nerve functioning. Also, anxiety/nervous or panic disorders are often accompaning this. Your description of the events leads me to think that is what is going on. Don't get me wrong, it is real and serious. But, proper meds and therapy will greatly be helpful. An increase in your b/p on admission and cardiac arrhythmias can also be stress/anxiety related.You may not view looking for answers to your problems as an obsession, but I think that perhaps it is. Also a sign of depression type of disorder. You have had a terrible past, you have every right to be angry. But truly, it is not normal to continue this vandetta. Therein lies the reason needing therapy for. It's the answer to how you are able to deal with all of the problems you have had in life. Is it funcitonal or non-funtional? Is it controlling your life to a small percentage and letting your children suffer from you thinking about these items or can you let them go and move on with your life?Do you have ample help at home? I am really concerned with your mental status. Also, I can clearly see that all of your questions have been answered. They may not be the way you wanted them to be, but again, that is part of the disorder. Take care and keep us updated as to your progress. Thoughts and prayers to you.",

I have read all that you say, and there is a lot of sense in it.I had postnatal depression after having my baby,and I still believe that I have it to some degree.\u00a0\u00a0I did have therapy, but moved country so I had to stop.\u00a0\u00a0To be honest I did not find it had much long lasting effect, I also attended a post-natal depression group once a week for three months, which did help me to put things into perspective.All that was a long time ago now, and the support network there fell apart unfortunately.But unfortunately, I have been told so many lies and there have been so little actions taken with all that went on at that time with this Trust, from the time I was on the assessment ward, to the time of\u00a0\u00a0delivery, and then when a midwife ignored my concerns about my baby on the post natal ward.\u00a0\u00a0He ended up in special care for five days cos of non action all day by this midwife. This has left deep scars on me.I also have insomnia and have done since all the trauma of an acrimonious divorce over 12 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0So this does not help.A lot has gone on, and I am trying to get help to deal with it by being involved with support groups and finding out the truth.\u00a0\u00a0The unit does not recognise or acknowledge the side effect \"burning\".\u00a0\u00a0This is so frustrating as everyone here recognises this effect.So why don't they?For my baby, I am hoping that the midwife will shortly be up in front of a midwifery council for her part in our pain.I have also managed through complaining about things to get this maternity unit to administer pain relief to babies for painful procedures, which they did not do for my son.I had to watch him writhe in agony while they stuck things in him, several times a day.After having three other children previously all reasonably okay, and being healthy throughout this pregnancy despite my age, this was a complete shock to the system.I had hoped for a natural birth, as I do not believe in drugs, as I now have no relationship with my mother because of her drug taking over 30 years.So I have had all four babies with not so much as even gas and air.\u00a0\u00a0And no I am not blowing my own trumpet, but I am proud of this fact.You asked do I have help at home, yes I have a partner, but he does not get very involved with my sons needs throughout the day, I look after him for 10 hours a day.Some days it is as much as I can do to be cheerful myself, but I do try to put on a brave face and have fun with him as much as I can.\u00a0\u00a0He has just started school so that gives him more interests and amis.My partner does not understand depression, or even try to.\u00a0\u00a0I sense that he thinks I use this as an excuse for no sex life or my moods.I am seriously trying to enjoy the time with my son, but some days it is very difficult to rid my mind of all that went on.But I am trying very hard to get back to as normal as possible.Thanks for your concern!!",

For everyone who recieves \"compensation\" all that hapens in that there is less and less money for that trust to provide proper care for thier patients.I believe that in using The National Health Care Service in the UK we have to accept that HUMAN BEINGS are the ones providing our care, no human is perfect and mistakes that could lead to tradgedies occasionally happen. My grandmother died last year as a result of being 3 times overdosed on her epilepsy medication for nearly a month, did our family sue the trust looking after her, no we did not, it wouldn't bring her back and it was a genuine mistake, no one intentionally overdosed her and I'm sure as heck the doctors and nurses involved learn't never to make that mistake again. Suing for any amount of money would not bring her back, all it would do is make that trust financially worse off which in turn would compromise the care of others.",

I experienced the flushing/burning sensation through my veins (as I did receiving it after my first emergency caesarean to deliver my son) so thought nothing of it til I found difficulty breathing and paralysis, I then went into respiratory arrest and was intubated, the crash team were called in. They realised the silly midwife hadn't closed the i.v drip bag off before reinserting it into my venflon so I received the whole dose which should have taken a few hours to go through in 5minutes. I was given calcium (the antidote to mag sulphate) and came round quickly. Unfortunately I needed additional help breathing so spent my first 24hours a new mum alone in high Dependancy unit whilst daughter cared for in neonatal. They have now changed the way mag sulphate is administered (now through a syringe driver) to prevent from happening again. Have had meeting & incident report on top of letter but they admitted human error. I was told I had a good case for suing - but what's the point?! The NHS is drained as it is why put it under further strain. I almost died from his medication and was lucky that they realised quickly what had happened to rectify the problem but I haven't really given it a second thought let alone spent 3years \"researching\" it coz you had a \"hot sensation\" ?!?!",
