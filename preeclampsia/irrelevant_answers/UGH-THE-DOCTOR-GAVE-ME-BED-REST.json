            "answer": "I have 2 friends who have had preeclampsia, and also a co-worker. My co-worker had to be on bed rest for 7 weeks, and my friends for 4-5. Follow your doctor's orders exactly and just try to stay positive; there are lots of things you can do while on bedrest to help the time go by. Here are some ideas:*Organize photos; make a photo box for baby's pictures and label each category by week, event, etc...*Organize your recipe book(s); flag the recipes that'll be easy to make when baby gets here.*Research how-to and recipes for making your own baby food.*Keep a journal of all your thoughts and feelings. Write letters to the baby.*Address envelopes for your birth announcements.*Organize your phonebook w/everyone's most recent contact information, including emails. Make a new section for babysitters.*Create your birth plan, if you want to have one.*Make a list of things to pack for the hospital; get some ideas from gals on here on what to bring if it's your first.*Seek new-mom clubs and forums online, and ways to get discounts and coupons for baby supplies.Best of luck to you - I will be 33 weeks tomorrow as well. We're getting close. :)",

In closing , go wash the car, love ma.\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there chica, I just came off 6 weeks of Bed rest and I got severely addicted to medhelp... :) I went back to work today and was all excited up until about 2om then I flashed back to how if I was home it was blueberry smoothie and nap time.

    "question": "Well, as some of you know, I am only 33 weeks and I have been really swollen the past few days. My mom finally convinced me to go back to see my doctor and she put me on bed rest. I gotta do 2 hours in bed, 2 hours up constantly throughout the day. She seemed really worried because I have gained 4 pounds in less than a week. So, I am on bed rest. I have to go back on monday for a weigh-in and if I havn't lost any water weight by then, she is gonna put me on 3 hours in bed, 1 hour up. And if that don't work then I will be put in the hospital. So, I better follow doctors orders. She thinks its pre eclampsia starting off. I sure hope not! Has anyone had this before and can tell me some about it?",
