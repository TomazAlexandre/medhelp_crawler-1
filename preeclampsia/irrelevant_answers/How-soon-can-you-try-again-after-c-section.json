            "answer": "I do not know never had one but I would imagine till the abdominal muscles and all other layers are healed which can take 6 weeks. I think this is something u should ask your DR. they would know the time frame for sure.Some women will start right away but that isn't always best bc your body needs to heal and if u do get pregnant quickly your body is now trying to heal and create a new baby. This is just my opinion talk to your doc",

Sadly my baby didn't make and my husband and I were devastated.\u00a0\u00a0Given the circumstance,\u00a0\u00a0my doctor gave me the green light to start trying after 3 months. I was pregnant again by March 2015 & I'm due in December.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I'm planning for a vbac as and not a repeat c section. Just find a provider to work with you who is supportive. In most cases however, it is generally recommended to wait 12-18 months between pregnancies :)\u00a0\u00a0good luck :)",

She said they initially planned to do vertical cut on my uterus but she ended up going horizontal. I was really excited about that. That means I might actually be able to deliver vaginally next time )) I almost cried when I heard that, the prospect of not ever experiencing vaginal delivery before somehow made me feel less like a woman..As far as getting pregnant again. She said Im healing well and can try again after 6 months )) Only forgot to ask her when she thinks I'll start ovulating since I'm pumping milk now and plan to continue breastfeeding..",

The doctor told me all my next babies will have to be born via c section as well. I already came to terms with that.. But have a question:If anyone had similar case, how long did you have to wait before trying to get pregnant again?This is my first baby but I always dreamt of having a large family (3-4 kids). I'll be 30 in a few months and feel like I dont have much time to waste. Want to start trying as soon as possible..",
