            "answer": "The headache may be due to high blood pressure which were my first signs of preeclampsia. I managed to pass the urine tests (24 hour collections are the worst) but my blood pressure never went down and my baby girl was born at 37 weeks so if you do have it they will monitor you closely and you will probably not carry past 37. That was my doctor's goal for me.The pain in your leg sounds like baby is positioned on your sciatic nerve which is uncomfortable but normal. I would mention the pain in your groin to your doctor as it could be pressure from baby. It could also just be baby dropping but it's good to be sure. Good luck and I hope the tests come out positive for you.",

            "answer": "Thank you!! My blood pressure isn't to bad It was worse in the begining of my pregnancy. Now they say its beautiful it was just that day that I went to the dr it was a little high but nothing to be to worried about said the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I go in a little while to the hospital to get blood work done. Last night the headaches were so bad I woke up at least three times in tears with them being so bad. I don't know what it could possibly be. I can't wait to go see the doctor and tell her. I'm just nervous that it'll be something bad.By the way, your right 24 hour urine collection *****!",
