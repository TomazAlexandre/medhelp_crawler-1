Young and older women have a higher chance of having a baby with ds because there is mire of a change that their eggs are faulty. Sounds like your mom in law wants to blame someone.

All I knew is my blood pressure was consistently outrageous, and my iron was almost flat-lining. I took maybe a total of 10 prenatal vitamins, and threw the rest out because of the nausea and vomiting it induced. I finally found other supplements that were baby-safe. Anyhow, I said all this to say, no, it wont cause Down's Syndrome, BUT if you're not on top of everything, it can be fatal for both mom and baby. Not trying to scare you, just being honest. I had never even heard of pre-eclampsia until I had a seizure and ended up in labor & delivery.",
