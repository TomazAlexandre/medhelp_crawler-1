            "answer": "I would switch doctors until you found one who took you seriously! Depending on your insurance, find all the providers in your area who accept your coverage and start making phone calls. Explain your case or see if the doctor is willing to review your previous records. If so, get your hands on them and start faxing to anyone willing to see them. Have the doctors now seen the records from before? If not it may be the reason why they are so ho hum with you. Sadly doctors don't take the word of their patients very seriously. Hopefully, you will find a doctor who realizes your risk and will take you on to ensure proper care and monitoring is necessary.Also, speaking of your insurance, I would find out how to lodge a formal complaint about the doctors with them. Good reputable insurers want to know when there are doctors giving half a$$ care. They are paying these people good money to practice good medicine. I mean there are companies who want to know if you are waiting too long in a waiting room before your appointment, imagine this! Considering that good care now can mean a less complicated delivery, healthier baby translating to less hospital care after birth translates to less money they have to pay. God forbid you have an early delivery again preceded by complications and hospitalizations, that means more money THEY have to pay out.I had to put it in terms of dollars and cents when clearly we are talking about the health of you and your child here, but sometimes it is worth \"thinking\" like them to get what you REALLY need. You have legal rights to reasonable care. If they do not realize the risks and something happens because of it and the fact they are not monitoring as necessary, you will have every right to sue their a$$es to keep it from happening to someone else. I don't think they want that to happen....The absolute best of luck to you for the rest of your pregnancy, I pray you have the pleasure of experiencing the joys of pregnancy, not being so stressed out. Please stick to your guns and listen to your body. It's obvious you understand your medical past and you know what kind of precautionary care you need. Don't give up and don't let these people shove you away. Doctors work for us and the insurance companies. Use your insurance company as your ally. Doctors have contracts with insurance companies, they don't just say \"hmmmm I'll join this network to make more money\". They are bound to contracts...",

            "answer": "If you feel that bad go to the emergency room. If you are by a childrens hosp. or one that deals with pe mature birth go there. I had the same thing @ 6mo. with my last preg. I went to the Dr , they hooked me up to a monitor to check for contractions, then sent us right to Childrens Hosp. I had to take a pill every 4 hrs. till I hit 34wks. to stop contractions. Don't mess around with this. I was on strict bed rest & had to go to the Dr every week to make sure my cervex stayed closed. It was my first PG so I wasn't sure if it was contractions but in my mind I knew something was wrong. if you go to the Hosp. tell them about your Dr & ask who they think you should see. Good Luck & keep us posted.",

            "answer": "To address what Jah just said: Do not by ANY means feel that because you are this far into your pregnancy, it would be difficult or not worth finding another doc.At 36 weeks with my 2nd I walked out of my OB's office with a copy of my records and op report from my first. He was trying to force me into another c section which I strongly felt was unnecessary (had one with my first for necessary reason). This is minor compared to your situation. But still at 36 weeks I found a practice willing to take me on and finish me out. About my situation, I was able to have a successful vbac.Look look and look some more. You will get the appropriate care because you deserve it and you are intune with your body and your history.Again, the best of luck.",

            "answer": "Well, looking at it from a different angle....it's understandable you'd like what would seem like extra care to keep you feeling secure everythings ok. But actually they have been doing what they're supposed to. At 19 weeks, you had labor pains- to check your cervix is the right thing to do, as well as sending you home when there's no change (meaning you weren't going into true labor and not going to deliver). Also, bleeding, although not common, is possible during pregnancy. So much depends on what else is going on. Again, clearly your water didn't break, your cervix didn't change (and I'm assuming they did check fetal heart rate,etc) and were sure your baby wasn't compromised. And again- without signs of your pregnancy in danger or your blood work completely out of whack, feeling 'faint' is again a vague and not uncommon symptom. What makes us feel safest as pregnant women is getting immediate tests and answers,etc., but the hardest thing is when yup..it's just part of this pregnancy and requires no medical intervention. Make sure they're watching ur blood pressure, but otherwise I'd believe at this point they are giving you good care.... just another thought...",

    "question": "I use to come here all the time (my old name was mamasboys). Im not 20 weeks pregnant with a girl. I have a 3 year old and 1 year old that are boys.I had severe preeclampsia with my first and had him at 33 weeks. I had mild preeclampsia with my next and preterm labor starting at 24 weeks and I had him at 35 weeks.I also had 2 c-sections and a miscarriage 2 months before I got pregnant with this baby.I moved here to TN from FL last year and my doctors here are just not being to careful with me at all and they don't seem to care that im high risk.I went to the hospital at 19 weeks for contractions and was sent home with them because my cervix hadn't changed. Then I went to the doctor 3 days later and told her I have been feeling faint and having lots of cramps and she told me I was prob coming down with something.I have been having contractions every day since. I had 7 strong ones today in an hour and then went to sleep. I woke up and felt better...I also had a lot of bleeding from 13-16 weeks and she acted like it was very normal and did nothing.What would you do/think if you were me? I had VERY good doctors in Florida and with my last pregnancy I was high risk from the start because of my pregnancy before that and I had to see them every 2-3 weeks and a high risk doctor every 2-4 weeks.Thanks for any input!",
