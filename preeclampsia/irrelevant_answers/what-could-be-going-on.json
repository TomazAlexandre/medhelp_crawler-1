    "question": "im 30 weeks 4 days along and I had an appoitment yesterday and my blood pressure was high 175 over 90, so I was sent to the hospital to be monitered and for blood work. Preeclampsia and infection were both ruled out, my blood pressure eventually went down so I got to come home. But this morning I had to go back to my doctors office this morning to have my blood pressure checked again and it was 168 over 60. My doctor was in delivery and the nurse told me they would call me tomorrow to let me know what is going on. Has anyone had anything like this happen to them before?",
