While you are waiting one thing to do is just take good care of yourself and get very good rest.\u00a0\u00a0Also ask about a good suppliment from your doctor if you are allowed.\u00a0\u00a0There are some liver support herbs but again you need to ask your doc about them.\u00a0\u00a0He probably will be reluctant until they get a firm diagnosis on you.Thoughts and prayers are with you!",

( I kinda want someone else to also look at the bloodwork and biopsy results)..........from what i can interpret, the report is diagnosing me with primary biliary cirhosis (Stage I)....it appears that damage to my bile ducts has started, but is still confined to that area (I guess that is supposed to be the positive in all of this)...what is not clear in the report is whether i also have autoimmune hepatitis...my gastro. doc stated he \"thinks\" i do.......the path report is reccommending more bloodwork.........i thought a biopsy would be able to confirm something like that??? anyways, it is apparently important to know because i believe the treatment of the 2 conditions is different......i think you take some type of bear bile drug with little or no side effects for the pbc, but for the aih, you take steriods and antiviral immunosuppresents with lots of lovely side effects...like the side effects are so bad that they alone could kill you...........if you or anyone else has any knowledge or insight in regards to this, it is much appreciated........Oh well........I hope i will learn more next week..........Also, how easy is it to get\u00a0\u00a0a liver transplant.........how many people die from not getting one?",
