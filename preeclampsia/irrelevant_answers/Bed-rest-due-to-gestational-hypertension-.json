            "answer": "I'm 37w5d and on bed rest due to bp as well. It has been high like yours all my pregnancy. I am going back and forth with protein in my urine so I see the dr every 2 days while he tries to figure out if it's preeclamsia or not. I'm on the max dose of meds he will give me and it is still in the 150s unless i am laying down.\u00a0\u00a0Just trying to make it to the 1st when my insurance switches over. I'm due the 10th but if it continues like this he will probably induce me right after the 1st.",

    "question": "I am 34 weeks 5 days. And put on bed rest til I deliver at 37 weeks. I was diagnosed with gestational hypertension last Monday. And put on blood pressure meds 1500mg a day. This Monday my feet and legs were so swollen that I couldn't get my shoes on. I checked my blood pressure\u00a0\u00a0and it was in the 170/110 range. I called my Dr and she had me come in right a way. She sent me to the hospital for monitoring and labs. The hospital said the baby looks great and labs were fine so they doubled my blood pressure meds to 3000 mg a day and sent me home. I do not have preeclampsia. According to a urine collection last week and blood work on Monday. I went back to their today and she is having me do another urine collection starting tomorrow for preeclampsia. And I was told I would be delivered at 37 weeks. Unless the test does come back preeclampsia. Anyone else had these problems?",
