            "answer": "Hi Shelly,Thank you for welcoming me. I'm on Doxycycline right now because of a bad UTI, they said it was e. coli. I'm getting a second opinion from a different nephrologist on the whole MSK matter so wish me luck because the first one wasn't much help! I want to make sure my kidneys are functioning correctly, etc. How do urologists/nephrologists test kidney function? The protein in the urine didn't start until after my daughter was born.Do you think pitocin could in any way damage kidneys that are already affected by MSK? Also, what do kidney stones feel like? Several weeks ago I had a horrible jabbing like pain on my left front side that went down to my groin. It was enough to double me over and I couldn't walk because it would sting worse. It came and went that night then came back several days later then stopped entirely. My mother said that with kidney stones you often throw up because it's so painful. I didn't throw up but whatever it was was definitely painful.Thank you again,Kimberlee",

            "answer": "Hi there and welcome,Sorry to hear all you are going thru. I have had a few similar experiences as you actually.\u00a0\u00a0I found out I had MSK after the birth of my 3rd child. I do not think Pitocin could damage your kidneys. I have passed alot of stones and to me they feel like a razor or a piece of glass is moving thru me! When the stones move thru the ureters it causes \"renal colic\"-or spasms of the ureters which can make you have nausea and bad pain.\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there!KimPS I was also in ER with chest pain recently and my BP was 150/105! They ended up putting me on BP meds...the doc told me I have excess fluid and I am pretty sure this is because of the MSK eventhough they said my BUN and CR. were ok",

I get angry sometimes because the docs act like the pain is in my head.\u00a0\u00a0I get bitter about this...like why or what did I do wrong...was it a prescription drug I took that caused this..too many vitamins...an herbal remedy?\u00a0\u00a0what and why?\u00a0\u00a0I have done research and the stuff I read is insane...like too much vitmain A or antifreeze poisoning and wierd stuff like that.....can cause the medularry calcinosis and it scares me.....and then they say it can be renal tubular acidosis or MSK....or hypercalcemia...I finally made my way to a kidney stone specailist at Vanderbilt in Nashville that said MSK was hard to diagnose.......I don't know.......I just know that I must have what Shelly was talking about...a low grade infection..hard to detect but, one that produces symtoms..............",

I too have a mvp w/ regergitation and major BP problems w/both my pregnancies & have been in a living hell for 2 years w/kidney stones & infections of kidneys , bladder & urinary tract & until yesterday never had a proper diagnosis. I diagnosed yesterday with MSK & I have severe pain no doctor has ever seemed to manage. i am doing my own research & Im going to find a doctor educated about MSK because Ive found so many doctors are clueless. AN Er radiologists finally found it on a catscan & no one ever bothered to tell memy diagnosis that Ive been waiting on for so long\u00a0\u00a0until 3 months later! I can't believe our health care system. If MSK patients speak up & have a loud voice about it & learn who to lean on to get research done on this disease then we can all have some relief in one way or another! Ill keep you in my thoughts!

            "answer": "Thanks everyone for all your support and your own stories when it comes to MSK. I just found out that I'm 4 weeks pregnant with my 3rd child. I've had 3 UTIs within 4 months and have yet another one right now. I've been having some bad cramping and I fear that a UTI could cause a miscarriage, has anyone ever heard of it happening? I'm calling my OB tomorrow to see how soon I can get in because I'm miserable right now and scared to death. I hope they'll see me even though it's so soon.Kim, I really do think there is a link too. The doctors were baffled that I didn't have all of the classic Preeclampsia signs. At the time of high BP I had no protein in my urine so they just said it was Pregnancy Induced Hypertension and left it at that. I didn't have protein until after my BP went down, crazy right? I honestly think that MSK can cause BP issues during and right after pregnancy. I don't see how it wouldn't and it explains a lot for me.",

    "question": "Hi everyone,I've recently learned that I have MSK along with moderate mitral valve prolapse + tricuspid valve regurgitation (10-15 cc's that leaks). I am 22 years old and all of this came about after my recent delivery of my daughter in November. I've always had UTI's but during labor with my second child I had a severe kidney infection and was induced. I later returned to the ER for complications (palpitations, shortness of breath, edema in my legs, bp was 180/104, etc) that's when they did a abdominal ultrasound and said I had MSK. I've seen a urologist who told me to see a nephrologist about it which I did two days ago but no one has been able to put my mind at ease.The nephrologist said that we have to do another blood test next month because some things were a little wacky in my blood and urine. I feel very alone and I feel like doctors just brush it off. I just keep fearing that my kidneys are shutting down. I'm also upset because I've been told no more children because of both the kidneys and heart. My urologist speculated that the kidneys were to blame for my bp problems in both my pregnancies (first thought to be because of PIH or Preeclampsia.) I'm not sure if anyone knows what blood test reports mean or how to translate them but here's my stats. In order from the oldest to the most recent the first one being in the being of November and the last being December 26th-1st) Blood- BUN 10, Creatine 0.8, and BUN/Creatine ratio 13. In my urine- no protein or blood.2nd) Urine- Occult blood 300, protein 30, leukocyte esterase 753rd) Blood- BUN 16, Creatine 0.7, and BUN/Creatine ratio 23. In my urine- no protein or blood, high white blood cells\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 but no infection.4th) Blood- BUN 22, Creatine 0.7, and BUN/Creatine ratio 31.9. In my urine- Blood 2+, red blood cells 25-50, high white blood cells.I just had another urine test done and they're trying to culture it. My cardiologist has stepped up and is the one actually ordering all the tests.Has anyone had protein/blood/white blood cells in their urine just because they have MSK? And is it bad that my BUN keeps increasing so fast? I wonder if my last pregnancy took a tole on my kidneys. I keep drinking a lot of water my urine is always a hazy yellow color (probably TMI!)Yesterday I finally cried my eyes out. I've been convincing myself everything is okay but it's no fun being told I not only have one birth defect but two! I am so thankful I found this forum. I was on the preeclampsia.org support forum and it was them who said women who have been told they have preeclampsia often times have underlying problems (kidneys/heart/liver) and to get it looked into. These forums definitely help. I really hope to hear back from someone it means a lot.",
