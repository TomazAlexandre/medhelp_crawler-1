But the symptoms to look for are a head ache that won't go away with Tylenol, pain at the top right of your stomach, and flashes on your vision. Also swelling I believe is one. Also, I'm almost 28 weeks.",

Hypertension, fatigue, blinded by white spots started at 15wks, hospital at 18wks, home now and don't feel too bad so fingers crossed I make it to 36wks.",
