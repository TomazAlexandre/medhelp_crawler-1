            "answer": "I had it at the very end of my pregnancy with my daughter. She was overdue five days. I went into the hospital for fetal monitoring, and found out my blood pressure was dangerously high. They induced me that day, because it wasn't safe for my daughter. After 16hours she was born healthy. She's now four and fine. I have not had any long term problems from developing preeclampsia with that pregnancy, and so far so good with this one. I'm 28weeks now.",
