            "answer": "My mom had it while pregnant with me. She had it two weeks before her due date and had to be induced. Im not sure if thats how it is for eveyone else. My mom was also very sick her whole pregnancy and the drs said i was in distress so they had to get me out a little early. But my mom is the only person i know that has had it. She didnt have it with neither of my little sisters(i have two little sisters) and she had a natural birth with all of us. Hope this helps a little :)",

They are monitoring my bp and I have to pee in this orange carton (kinda like a milk carton at the store) and they'll check that in the morning and if It's above 300 (the amount of protein) I'm gettin' induced. My bp has been up.and down to very high to a lil' bit higher than normal. If it continues to stay very high, they're gonna induce me tonight but right now its a mix. They are monitoring baby as well and juss had an u/s to check his fluids and see if everythin looked good. But from what I know, I'm goin' to be induced either tomorrow or if the urine test comes out lower than 300 and my bp lowers, I get to go home but will get induced at 39 weeks.",
