            "answer": "I have them take my blood pressure at the end of the appointment because it is sky high when I first go in .For some reason I get SO nervous when I go see the OBGYN. Its never happened before. Its still higher than normal at the end of the appt too. I borrowed my moms blood pressure cuff and\u00a0\u00a0take it at home and its nice and low so I keep track of it, write it down and bring it to the Dr. Regarding your shortness of breath, I think that is pretty normal in pregnant women, but Im not sure, this is my first and when I go for my daily walks I am definitely sucking more air than when I wasnt pregnant. Im 15wks",

            "answer": "I could be mistaken, but it sounds too early for preaclampsia ... I believe that is traditionally a LATE second trimester/third trimester issue (you usually get tested between 24-28 weeks for your blood sugar). It is normal for your blood pressure to increase with pregnancy, and if your doctor is not concerned, I wouldn't be concerned about that aspect; however, I would hate not being able to breathe well. As you grow, it certainly seems harder to breathe, but I would probably ask about that again at the next appointment since you are feeling strained in the middle. Also, in regards to your ribs, if you are having pain, it is possible that you have cosochondritis, but it may be too early for that as well. I started having rib pain right at five months and my six months was told that I had cosochondritis (tearing of the cartiledge surrounding the ribs which causes pain and inflamation). Although it was nice to know what it was, it wasn't much help since all I can take right now is Tylenol and that hasn't been working for almost two months! ;0) Good luck!",

    "question": "I would just like some feedback on the following happenings this week.\u00a0\u00a0I realize that all of these things are regular pregnancy things, I just would like some other opinions.\u00a0\u00a0After all, if you watch Grey's Anatomy, you know doctors make mistakes too :)- 2 Fridays ago I had my OB-GYN appointment and my blood pressure was 140/I don't remember... mine is normally 112 or so and never has been higher.\u00a0\u00a0They said maybe I was nervous- why would I be nervous?!- Since then, blood pressure has been checked twice and remained over 130.- During the past two weeks, I've been having problems breathing, like my rib cage got smaller.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor suggested that I had asthma all the sudden and put me on Singulare (sp?), and after a week no results.- Past few days, headaches!\u00a0\u00a0And unfortunately, extra strenght Tylenol doesn't work\u00a0\u00a0:(I am still so tired and weak, though they did rule out anemia.\u00a0\u00a0I've read about preeclampsia and all of that... I just don't know if the blood pressure is of worry.\u00a0\u00a0I am young, so it's not like an age thing.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor just said its okay to be tired (like 5 hours of energy a day, literally) and said that my blood pressure at 140 was fine.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts?",
