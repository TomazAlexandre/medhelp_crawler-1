    "question": "I'm 28 weeks. Yesterday I woke up and couldn't even move outta bed. As I went with my mom somewhere , I had burning pains in my back, she said it could have been contractions but she wasn't sure. The baby could come any time since I'm threatened with preeclampsia. I haven't slept good in two days and my back is killing me and I keep having horrible sharp pains in my stomach on and off. I tried calling my obgyn but supposedly there's no nurses or my doctor on call and if it gets bad go to the hospital. What would you do?",
