    "question": "So monday I had my 37 week prenatal appointment. Me and my husband left to go run an errand and then went straight home. Once we got home, I went to the bathroom to pee. Once I stood up my water broke. Wasn't expecting it to be dramatic like the movies, but it was! Like I had a bucket of water pour out of me and didn't stop for hours. Rushed to the hospital with my husband. I had some problems with my blood pressure, but once I got to the hospital they immediately started treatment for me. They discovered I had preeclampsia. I was only dilated 1cm upon arrival. They induced me and finally after approximately 18 hrs of labor and 24 mins of pushing, I had my baby girl at 6lbs 9oz at 9:49am Tuesday. Almost didn't make it because my blood pressure was so high. I thank God that me and Kairi are healthy and still alive. I was unaware of how severe my condition was until I was told by my dad. God is so good. He definitely has a plan for me and my daughter. And the staff at the hospital are so good to me. Still here and don't know when I'll be able to leave. If my blood pressure stays down like it should then it should be within a couple days. Praise God!",
