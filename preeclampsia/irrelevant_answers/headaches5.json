            "answer": "Stress will certainly bring on headaches. I get severe migraine from stress. You need to relex and take a day for yourself without anything or anyone bothering you. I know it's difficult but will help. I totally understand if you have other kids at least try and go just get a massage or pedicure but something for yourself. I like to say call in back up! :) If you are stressing over things that you don't need to you need to stop that. :) It's bad for you and baby and doesn't help anything. I know easier said than done but for your own sanity try and declutter as much from your life that isn't necessary right now. Being pregnant is stressful in itself even if it's a great pregnancy. Im not trying to sound mean. I just went thru this exact thing a few weeks ago. Was stressing so much ended up borderline depressed. Once I said enough I don't need to worry about this or this or this its out of my hands I started feeling much better. Do something for yourself and it will certainly help.",

            "answer": "Trying to do all of that now. I'm always a stresser not just now so my body is pretty well adjusted sadly. But I've been getting some bills paid off and trying to be organized and keep my sanity. I do get depresssed sometimes as well but mostly when I get home sick and think about my dad or grandpa who are gone.... I'd love to call for back up but my family lives 700 miles away and the inlaws are more like friends who end up being rude the few times a year we see them so you just learn to avoid them lol",

            "answer": "I'm sorry. Any friends around that can help? Good job on bills getting paid off. I know that can always give a slight ray of relief... I just paid off my hospital bill over been working on for a couple years! But like I said just doing something simple for yourself helps. As for the headaches take Tylenol and a nap and a warm bath. Helps you relax also",

I keep getting bills paid and then overdraft my account lol I need to find a better balance but I'm getting there! I have a few medical bills I still need to get paid from 2 years ago as well, they suck big time.",
