    "question": "Hospitalized yesterday after my 33week appointment :( Doctor said I had high bp, swelling, and protein in my urine. They're keeping me for at least 24 hours for observation. Has anybody had this happen to them without it being preeclampsia? Well, at least I got to see my baby girl again and she's doing great so far. Prayers please!",
