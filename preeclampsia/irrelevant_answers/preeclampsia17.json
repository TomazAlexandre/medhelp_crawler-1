            "answer": "Symtoms are high bp, seeing stars, bad headaches all the time, swelling in hands and face, protein in urine. If you make sure to have at least 90grams of protein a day your chances at getting it are very small. A study was done that proves it is caused by not enough protein and the women who had 90grams did not get it.",

They were managing it ok until I went into preterm labour at 27wks. They managed to stop it 3times and iI'm now 31wks, hopefully will make it to my csection at 36wks. Depending on how high the protein is they can manage the symptoms for a while with different bp meds, calcium, aspirin, and a low fat diet.",
