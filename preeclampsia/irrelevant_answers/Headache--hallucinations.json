Meaning you could be dehydrated which in turn makes your other symptoms worse.",

    "question": "Hi everyone, I'm 12w3d and a ftm and was wondering if I should be concerned..This past Saturday I had an incredibly terrible headache and started seeing things, it looked like spots or bugs crawling on the walls and ceiling. I've been super sick to my stomach and dizzy ever since, is this normal? I read somewhere that stuff like this can happen with preeclampsia but my bp has been around 90/50 so I don't think it's that. Any ideas?",
