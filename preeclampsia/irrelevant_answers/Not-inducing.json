I have heard that contractions with pitocin are way worse than normal labor pains, and I want to avoid getting an epidural.I do have to admit I cried when they first told me because I am in a lot of pain and am not really able to eat anything, but then commen sence came back to me and I realized that this is what I want. A healthy, natural birth with as little medical intervention as possible, just like my first one.",
