            "answer": "I had severe preeclampsia as well. I was put on bed rest around my 24th week, was admitted to the hospital at 33 weeks and my son was delivered a week later by csection at 34 weeks. He was in the nicu for a week and is a healthy happy baby! Your body really does know something is up. You may not feel sick but your body is very much ready for the baby to be out which is the only cure for preeclampsia. I had trouble sleeping the further I got along but I don't know if that was from being uncomfortable or what. I know insomnia is part of being pregnant and you can take OTC stuff to make you sleepy like Benadryl. Try to stay as calm as relaxed as you can throughout the whole thing, I know it's tough. At points my blood pressure was 190+/100+ and during the csection it spiked to over 200+\\110+ but after baby is out and as your hormones start to balance over the next couple weeks/ months you will get back to normal. Although the not sleeping part may be related to the new addition :)",

            "answer": "I've no experience with pre eclampsia, but I'm 37+4wks and started with the insomnia at about 36wks too. Its just our bodies preparing for a lack of sleep! I had it with both of my other 2 as well. Unfortunately the insomnia never lasted for me once my babies arrived and I was just plain exhausted and could've slept for weeks! I waken every morning at 5am just now but chances are that if thats when baby gets up, I'll not be as happy to get up as I am now!!",

            "answer": "Thank you for your responses. I'm sure functioning on little to no sleep will be no picnic. Like I said this is my first baby, but I used to breed Siberian Huskies and was up at all hours of the night. Funny how I was by her side and now she's glued to my hip. Back to the pre-eclampsia my Dr is going to see if I have progressed any tomorrow and if not they were talking of inducing next week which will be 37 weeks. Congrats on your little boy! I am waiting for the surprise factor. Driving everyone crazy! If the baby's sleep pattern stays this way I'll be sleeping during the day. Good luck!",

    "question": "1st time mom, 36w + 0d. Was curious if insomnia is any sign of what is to come. I was 50% effaced and 1cm dilated Monday been experiencing pressure, increase in bh, a watery discharge, and borderline diarrhea (sorry if tmi). I have been on bedrest at home since 27w because of pre-eclampsia. Last 24 hr had 510 protein level and will get this weeks results Thursday. I am more wide awake now than I have been all day and was curious if all together my body may know something that I don't. Anyone with something similar?",
