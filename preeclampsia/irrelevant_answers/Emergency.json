Was ok for a few months now it's back I just recieved a script for prozac gonna start at a 5mg dose to see if it helps. Go in if it makes you feel better....get checked over. Just relax. Everything will be ok. I am currently 16w1d. Deep breathing helps when I get like that. Hugs!",

I've had panic attacks since I was 12 but the vision loss is new to me. x_x They'll probably tell me it was a panic attack or they don't know what happened or oh it happens, but I'd rather know what it's NOT and that everything is ok. I feel like the baby's okay, but I need to know if I'M healthy because I have to carry the baby lol",

My body kind of got a chill, then had a tingling/numbing feeling all over my body, my vision started getting hazy and the edges were getting black. I sat down and it slowly went away and then I felt the need to throw up but it subsided also.",

Your blood pressure can drop when you are standing still, mixed with low blood sugar will make you loose vision and pass out. I have hypoglcemia so this is familar to me. Try drinking some juice and eat some protein and you should start to feel better.",

    "question": "I was cooking and as I was draining the noodles, I got really weird feeling (started feeling it a moment or two before but I get panic attacks a lot so I brushed it off) and then my vision started to get black around the edges and fading. I immediately called my mom and she said it sounded like preeclampsia? I'm only 14 weeks, almost 15. FTM, 20 years old.Recently moved and under stress. Got new back pains, no headaches but was dizzy for a moment the other day, vomiting suddenly came back, last time was at 9 weeks, and now this. Everything I'm reading about preeclampisa says these can be symptoms...At 14 weeks????I'm calling my doctor now and they'll definitely tell me to come in, but...I'm scared.Could be just a panic attack. I get them a lot. But I'm so scared.",
