    "question": "Someone very important to me was 37 weeks pregnant, went to the hospital because her feet and legs were swollen.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately her OB was on vacation so she was stuck with the on call OB doctors there, that made the decision to let her try to go through labor on her own.\u00a0\u00a0Her blood pressure when she got there was 160s/90s they said she was borderline preeclampsia???? But they gave her b/p med. They put some kind of med on her cervix to help her dilate,\u00a0\u00a0after 24 hours she didn't dilate very much but she was having active contractions, so they started giving her Patosin (broke her water). Dilated to 4 never dilated further than that the babys heartbeat started having problems so they said they had to do a C-section.The baby came out with some mucous in chest and nose , but other then that is fine.\u00a0\u00a0The mother unfortunately is now unable to receive guest's ( only husband and her parents).\u00a0\u00a0They cannot get her blood pressure down. Her OB got back said she should never have gone into labor. They should have just done C-section right away. She had preeclampsia the whole time.\u00a0\u00a0They are telling everyone to pray for her.\u00a0\u00a0What the ****???\u00a0\u00a0I don't mean to sound stupid but what is preeclampsia and she seemed fine right after the baby was born, so excited about being a mother.\u00a0\u00a0And ready to get on with her life and leave, I mean other than her feet and legs still being really swollen.\u00a0\u00a0I'm scared. Please tell me she's going to be fine.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
