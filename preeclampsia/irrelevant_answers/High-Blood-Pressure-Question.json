            "answer": "In all actuality, you have to move around and such. You are up more than down, right?\u00a0\u00a0One of the biggest problems with pregnancy and high b/p is that it can actually cause the placenta to break loose from the uterus. I don't mean to scare you, but the dr is probably right.\u00a0\u00a0When your b/p is up, your blood vessels are constricted (tight and small). Your baby is not getting the oxygen level that he/she would if your b/p was normal.This can stress the baby. When you take a b/p med, your blood vessels dilate(open up and get bigger) to lower the pressure. Did he do blood test and have you had protein in your urine? Personally, I'd rather be safe than sorry.\u00a0\u00a0Take the pill the same time (say 9am) every morning. It will also help out when you go into labor to prevent a stroke, seizure or stress the baby. You can still monitor your b/p and move around which is healthy. Best wishes, tmv\u00a0\u00a0p.s.",

            "answer": "Hi there. I had pre-eclampsia with all three of my pregnancies. Toxemia is the full blown version of pre-eclampsia which is pregnancy induced high blood pressure. Toxemia is a serious risk, but if the doctors are aware you shouldn't reach that point. I never took any blood pressure medication until my babies were born. My first was induced at 38 weeks, my second & third I went into labour at 38 weeks. My first the hbp started at about 32 weeks and I was hospitalized at 35 weeks. My second & third the hbp didn't start until I went into labour, and my blood pressure went 190/120. The risk with high blood pressure in pregnancy is that the placenta doesn't work it's full capacity which may cause low birth weight babies. The risk of it going as high as mine did in labour is a stroke. All my children are in perfect health, they just started out small(6lbs) by one they were perfectly average. My eldest is 14 today and towers over me.Do research into the medication that they recommend and weigh your options. Any blood pressure over 140/90 should be monitored regularly, if yours if higher than that I would consider the medication. Good luck.",

What you are saying still makes the most sense to me....unless like one of the posters above said, that the blood vessels are too restriced DUE to the high blood pressure and if you take the meds it will open them to get blood to the baby normally.

            "answer": "All three of pregnancies ended in emergency c-sections. First one was due to distress and high blood pressure - labour 16 hours. Second one I elected for c-section but as she came early they still had me in labour for more than 16 hours, the blood pressure got higher the longer I was in labour and they gave me magnesium sulphate to try and control it. Third one I also elected a c-section as I predicted the same would happen as before, he came early also and my blood pressure was at 160/110 when I arrived at the hospital 8 hours into labour and kept getting higher, only in labour 12 hours that time. I think if you are already on medication that it should help it stay under control when you go into labour. For me the doctor is not going to let me going into labour this time and hopefully that works. I hope this helps.",

    "question": "I posted on Friday about a specialist telling me that there is a problem with the vascularization of the placenta, and that I will probably have preterm delivery due to high blood pressure, toxemia, or preeclampsia. So, I went to my original OB today and without seeing the results of the ultrasound from the specialist, my doctor said I have pre-existing chronic hypertension. However, I completely disagree. I never had problems with my blood pressure and my doctor basically ignored what I was trying to tell him the specialist said. So here is my question. The specialist said that the baby will be telling my body he needs blood and my body will have to compensate by pushing the blood harder to get it through the placenta. So, if my doctor gives me a medication to treat hypertension, that stops my body from pumping hard, if the baby says he needs blood, will my body not respond because he gave me a medication to prevent it? I am so worried about taking this medicine, and causing the baby to slow down in growth. I have to start going every week, with an ultrasound every 3 weeks. I am still really worried about taking the medication. Has anyone else dealt with high blood pressure, or anything like this? Any help would be great!",
