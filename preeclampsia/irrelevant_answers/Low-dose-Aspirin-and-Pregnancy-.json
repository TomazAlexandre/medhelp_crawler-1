    "question": "Hi my name is Jennifer I am currently pregnant with my 3rd child, I have had a history of preeclampsia with both of my two previous pregnancies. At my 13 week consultation I was asked by my doctor to start taking low dose Aspirin. However I did not, in fear that it would harm my baby or make me bleed. Now I am 18 weeks and 4 days pregnant in my second trimester and I am willing to start now and give it a try. Is it still ok to take it this later in pregnancy? Do woman usually start taking Aspirin in their second trimester? I really don't want the same complications I had with my other two sons and I realize I should have followed my doctors order, now I am afraid to ask my doc because I don't want to be a non compliant patient.",
