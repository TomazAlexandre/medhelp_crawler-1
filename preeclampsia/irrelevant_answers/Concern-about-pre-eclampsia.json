            "answer": "This heart board also has a section that is simply support, others with heart problems that can share their own experience. Does the pregnancy section have that or is it just \"ask a doctor\" forum?Blood pressure can fluctuate throughout the day; it's not static. With the added blood volume and burden (although a pleasant one) on the body I'm not surprised if your BP is a bit higher than normal. But with your history I think I'd mention it to the doctor. They can do a urinalysis, check your BP (which they probably do at each visit). At my clinic I can walk into the nurses station and have my BP checked without any charge or appt. That way they can chart it and my doc can keep track of how I'm doing. I hope everything turns out just fine. Congrats on the new baby on the way. Enjoy!",

    "question": "Hi, I am 28 years old, 16 weeks pregnant with my second child. I am of slim build and have normal blood pressure usually.In my first pregnancy (10 years ago) I had pre-eclampsia in the last month of pregnancy (rising/high blood pressure blurring vision and protein in urine) and was induced due to this coupled with being slightly overdue.As far as I understand it, it is rare for pre-eclampsia to occur at my present early stage in pregnancy, but I have recently noticed blood pressure reading variations that concern me and lead to wonder if this is a sign of the later possibility of developing it.At first most readings in early pregnancy and before have been somewhere between 60/100 and 75/115. However I had a new reading yesterday, which was 78/135.Can you tell me if I should be concerned and/or what other symptoms or signs I would be advised to watch for?",
