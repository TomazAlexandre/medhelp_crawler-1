            "answer": "I apologize in advance for breaking in on this thread & I am hoping that Jim will catch this.Jim-this is a quick synopsis of my treatment, discussed on Wed.F,1B with possible viremia,lobular inflammation-2, portal inflammation-3, fibrosis-4. (Starting weight 225.)This is ok since I am 7ft. tall!!!!Unfortunately when I was diagnosed In Jan. 02, I panicked & my only thoughts were to get rid of this disease asap. I was advised to see a top Gastro in Orl., without doing any research on the disease or Doctor. This was my first big mistake.I was placed on a wait-list for Peg-Intron/Riba & started therapy in 9/02, .5 peg,1200 Riba. The meds were reduced one mth. later to 2.5 Peg, 800 Riba, for 7 weeks, due to sides.They were then increased to .5 peg, 800 Riba. Sides were horrendous, resulting in 2 ER visits (dehydration& ears), & 2 units of blood in 7/03. This Gastro offered no help and his standard answer was \"I havae never heard of this happening.\" I finished this therapy on 8/03.(48 wks.) I showed undetectable in 12/02 & throughout the remaining mths. my VL & enzymes fluctuated terribly.I was considered a non-responder & then a relapser.By 10/03, the Hep C was back at 5,280,000. I took a break, and researched, found a Hep C Specialist,won an insurance appeal and I was ready to go again. This time much more informed.I started Infergen .5 daily and 1200 Riba. At 12 weeks my VL was 360, and then I showed 6 consecutive non-deductibles.Sides were just as bad, resulting in 8 falls. (luckily, I had enough cushioning, that I didn't break every bone in my body) My Hep C Specialist gave me everything in the world to help me get through this, as well as his strong support. Thinking I was clear, my family whisked me away to N.C. for some R&R.I felt good for 3 wks. & then my body told me something was wrong. On 8/5, my VL was 12,300,000 & enzymes rising. Back Again.I was put on Pegasys Maintainence at this point for 6 wks, .4 per wk. Again here came the sides. Back to the Doctor and my VL was 30,200,000 and you guessed it back on maintainence, where I am today.I have no stamina, fatigued all the time, sore mouth, etc. My main concern at this point is that my feet & legs go numb, without any warning.I have been to a Neurologist, carpal tunnel-can you believe? I saw an Orthopedic Surgeon on 2/03/06, who diagnosed it as a back problem. MRI's done. On 2/28/06, I received a cortisone injection in my left knee-did nothing. I was then referred to see a Neuorosurgeon, which I will see on 3/8/06. It appears that from X-Rays, I have degenerative canal stenosis, which means that I have narrowing of the lumbar spinal column, that produces pressure on the nerve roots resulting in sciata & inadequate blood supply to the muscles.HaveI had this all along or is this the effects of theinterferon? Who knows?My Hep C Doctor is speaking with Dr. Schiff at U.of FL., & has forwarded all info there including biopsy slides for him to evaluate and see if I am a candidate for the 2nd. round of VX-950.Can my body tolerate this-I am not sure, but willing to try.I hope I have covered everything, if not, let me know. Hang in there. Sandy",

I'm sorry you're having to go through all this, but it's obvious you're a real fighter, and in the end, that's what will get you through all this. Dr. Schiff has an excellent reputation and sounds like consulting with him is right next step. Please let us know what he says.

My family wants me to quit on the interferons, as like everyone else, it has played havoc with my life. In all probability the falls which I incurred are probably the lumbar issues. Does the name \"Doubledose\", mean that you have gone through\u00a0\u00a0therapy twice -or did you take a mega-size dose? How long have you been off meds? Congratulations on your achievement!

I never asked the doctor why I just wrote it down on my pads of notes when I started.I hope you are feeling better. Remember ice cream...in all it's billions of flavors and colors - is a very fun way to replace the antacids hee hee.\u00a0\u00a0Plus...if you are like some of us who have lost too much weight - it helps with that (that's my good excuse)Of course Rocker doesn't like using so many dairy products and has advised me to use low fat and yogurt...they help too.",

Mr. BBB I think this would also mean Maalox as well - check with the doctor.Some precipitant drugs bind with object drugs in the stomach or the intestine and inhibit their ability to be absorbed into your bloodstream. For example, if you take the antibiotic ciprofloxacin with most antacids, the combination will dramatically reduce the amount of antibiotic getting into your bloodstream.If you are taking ribavirin capsules, tell your doctor if you are taking antacids. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.This includes antacids containing aluminum or magnesium or products that contain simethicone. Patients with hiv infection taking stavudine or zidovudine should talk with their doctor or pharmacist before using ribavirin. The effectiveness of these medicines against hiv may be reduced when given with ribavirin.Ribavirin + Antacids. The UK makers of ribavirin note that there was a minor 14% decrease in the AUC of ribavirin when it was given with an antacid ...Antacid. The bioavailability of ribavirin 600 mg was decreased by co-administration with an antacid containing magnesium, aluminium and methicone; ...That all came from a bunch of different sources and I could probably print up another 100 of them but it's enough to show why we CANT take them.",

            "answer": "You can take antacids on treatment, but if you don't want to compromise ribavirin absorption, you have to allow a window (2-3 hours?) between the riba and the antacids -- probably err on adding time if they contain aluminum or magnesium which I believe drugs like Gaviscon might. Similar precautions should also be taken with flax (and possibly similar products like Metamuscil) as they also can interfere with drug absorption.Depending on your symptons, a better choice than antacids might be prescption PPI's such as Nexium, Priolosec, etc, or a class of drugs called histamine receptor antagonists such as Zantac which can now be found OTC. Both these drug classes can be taken with riba with no problems as they operate on a different principle than antacids.\u00a0\u00a0They are also generally considered more effective for serious reflux or GERD.-- Jim",
