            "answer": "I had a problem with high blood pressure between weeks 18-23 with this pregnancy. I had been super sick and was scared I was going to get dehydrated (had a stomach bug that WOULD NOT go away) so I was drinking powerade/Gatorade a lot. It never caused a problem before. Well after the third high reading doc said that I may have a problem so I started looking at my diet. Nothing had changed except the powerade/Gatorade, so I stopped drinking them and within that next week my BP was back down to 115-130\u00a0\u00a0over 50-60. (Those drinks are high in sodium because they are made for athletes that sweat alot to keep them from being dehydrated and week) My perfect numbers. So if anything has changed, might want to cut it out and see if it helps!",

    "question": "At my appointment today my blood pressure was very high, no protein in my urine but dr drew blood to make sure nothing is wrong. I should get results tomorrow. My question is, aside from stress and being in pain, what could have caused my blood pressure to be that high? I was in a good mood and not in any severe pain so it rules those out.
