I had a natural vaginal birth, and an emergency csection.. sometimes I still feel cheated that I didn't get hear my baby's first cry.. But Im happy knowing my baby is here and safe vs risking his/my life just to hear that one cry. Congratulations!! :-)",

    "question": "Hi everyone,I am 37 and have had 2 previous pregnancies, both ending in c-sections. My oldest is 18. I was induced 4 weeks early with her due to preeclampsia and when I didn't dilate after 5 hours the dr. decided on c-section. Fast forward 7 years and I had my son. He was a planned VBAC but again I was induced at 39 weeks and didn't dilate so the dr. did a c-section after 4 hours. It has been almost 12 years since baby #2 was born and we are blessed with #3. I am currently 14 weeks pregnant and really want to do VBA2C (VBAMC). Can anyone offer their experiences as to good-idea or bad-idea. This will definitely be our last child and I have always felt somewhat cheated not doing a normal vaginal delivery. But, I want to do what is safe for baby and me, and if that means a 3rd c-section then I will do it. I've always thought that if I had gone into labor naturally that vaginal birth would have been possible. Any thoughts?",
