    "question": "Hi girls so this is my labor story so on tuesday at about 3 am i started feeling cramps and i thought to my self oh its just another sleepless night with all these aches and pains so i just shaked it off well later on they started to get worse and just to get some ease of mind my sis took me to the hospital well i honestly thought maybe its false labor or something well i got sent home at around 11pm the midwife said i was not in labor..As soon as i got home i took a bath to see if i felt better but no i just felt worse i started to feel back labor AGAAINNNN!!! I called the midwife told her what was going on because it got to the point it was hard for me to walk so she told me to wait one hour see how i felt take a bath and relax obviously i couldn't and as soon as i hung up i started to shake and vomit to i basically told my mom take me to the other hospital as soon as we got there they got me hooked on iv put me in a room and monitored me for about a half hour then they gave me an epidural i felt sooo releived but at same time i was scared the doctor discussed how we would be able to try for vbac like he was all about it so that definitely encouraged me more half hour into it he was all about me getting epidural if i needed it so i got it...the epidural was going good until they had me lay on my side to put this sort of like birthing ball in between legs i started to feel contractions all over my right side it was unbearable and i had made a jump from 4 to 6cm fast so my thought was this is working but the epidural was not i would press and press it and it was as if i didn't even have it so i told the dr and he said he might have to switch it out for a new one but hesistated and he didn't until i told him i couldn't take the pain anymore since i was having bad back labor and then baby was putting lots of pressure i felt need to push but they wouldn't let me and the epidural was def not working then the doctor finally decided to switch it for new one again all was going well until they had me do the same thing with that birthing ball so i became misarable again then they had gotten some lab work done and said i had preeclampsia and was getting an infection so i had to basically get repeat csection and since epidural was not working i had to get a spinal block which at this point it was painful to sit since baby was engaged they tried to get it right the first time but dr wasn't convinced he was concerned it was more to left than right so he kept trying to put it right in place finally he got it and i felt completely numb as soon as my baby was born i started to feel the tugging i had lots of scar tissue and they gave me general anesthesia and was completely out of it asleep... When i woke up the dr talked to me saying the process he had to do and told me that reason why i was in so much pain in hip was due to baby being positioned with her shoulder first so everytime theyd check me they were feeling her shoulder not her head.. I went through sooo much for my baby girl it was scary yes but im glad she is healthy and doing good.. Im just soo thankful i was blessed with her despite how rough everything was i would not change having it any other way only because she filled my heart with love and she was the missing piece to my family :)",
