    "question": "Miss Olivia Claire made an early arrival. She wasn't expected until October first but came at 3:52Pm September 8th 2014! They induced me due to preeclampsia but seeing that there were no real changes and with every contraction her rates dropped they went ahead with a semi emergency cesarean section. I wanted all natural but got the epidural anyway and it wasn't too bad. I miss feeling her inside me but I love holding her outside",
