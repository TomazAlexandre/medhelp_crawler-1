    "question": "So today I went to the drs because I had an appt tomorrow but was in the area today. My whole left side (feet/toes,hands,fingers) have been swollen. My.right ankle baaad right now. Well today I'm 2 centimeters dilated, and 50% effaced. Also, stayed at the hospital to have blood work done and to see if I had preeclampsia. Well I'm home and now I have to pee into a bowl that goes into the toliet for the next 24 hours. Tomorrow I go back to labor and delivery to give it to them and have another NST (stress test). The urine is on ice and my bf says \"that's disgusting\"! Lol Yet he's older than myself and its funny because after I said that, hesays it's life baby gotta do what we have to do. This is so different now that he's all in and excited about his son. He says \"this is our love child\"! He has 3 kids (17,16,14) and we have my son who's 7 and now a lil man on the way!!!!",
