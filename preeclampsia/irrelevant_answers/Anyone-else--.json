            "answer": "I actually planned on having my kids 2 years apart. We had an unplanned c-section with my first, but my doctor is perfectly fine with me doing a trial vbac with this one. Tomorrow we will be 31 weeks and her opinion hasn't changed. I think it would be best to speak with your doctor and get their opinion on how long you (specifically you due to your pregnancy history) and what would be the healthiest and safest option for you and your future baby.",
