    "question": "So I'm 20 weeks now but I always had a smooth pregnancy up until now. I had one Oreo cookie yesterday and since then I've been feeling ill. Doesn't help that I came across a sick pregnant lady in the evening yesterday. After having the Oreo, I threw up fifteen minutes later. Then for dinner, I had vegetable soup and chicken curry. I had a glass of water as well. Maybe ten minutes later I threw everything up. I tried eating some crackers so I had something in my stomach.This morning I haven't been feeling well either and have the urge to throw up, but I only have crackers in my system from last night and this morning. I also feel I have some mucus in my throat that I just want to cough up.I don't know if this is normal. I have heard of morning sickness but GI problems starting mid pregnancy?? I looked up information online and it led me to preeclampsia. :/ my blood pressure is normal though. I guess doc will tell me if my urine sample has protein in it by tomorrow. But what can I do now to help my symptoms? :(",
