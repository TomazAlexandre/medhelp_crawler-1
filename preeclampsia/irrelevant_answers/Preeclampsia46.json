            "answer": "I had preeclampsia.. It all started with the swelling on my feets hands ankles ... My hands would fall asleep all the time it would even wake me up at night it was painful ... I think It started when I was 29-30 weeks pregnant ... And my doc told me to eat less food with salt and drink alot of water .. As the weeks went by the swelling got worse it was very painful to walk my shoes wouldnt fit . I had to get some blood work done and do a 24 hr urine test eveything seemed to be fine except the swelling I didnt have any headaches ... When I was 35 weeks It was soo bad even my legs thighs were very swollen I went in and my blood pressure was sky high .. That day my doc sent me to l&d and sure they told me I had preeclamsia and that I wasnt going home pregnant . It was heart breaking but it was the best for me and baby .. I was induced and had my babygirl at 35 weeks and 6days ... Btw my bp was at 183 when ai got to l&d ..",

    "question": "Ive been having some swelling for about two weeks. Ive been telling my doctors but they said its normal. My blood pressure is usually around 110/60. Ive kept a headache but towards 3ish when i start to swell really bad i get a headache so bad it feels like my head is swelling and i get so dizzy i have to lay down. Today I had an appointment with a different midwife then i usually see. I have gained 6lbs in one week. My blood pressure was 130/90, the nurse said that was high. I told the midwife how ive been swelling and always have a headache and that my blood pressure was high. She was pretty rude and said that it was normal, only time to be worried is when i have a headache, i tried to explain to her i keep a really bad headache but she just said come back and two weeks and left. Anyone know what the signs are for preeclampsia or what to do?",
