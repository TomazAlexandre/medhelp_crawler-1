This time they picked it up at 15wks and they were managing it really well but I went into labour at 27wks and am still in hospital 6 days later trying not to have this baby. Its very serious and while they can't prevent it there is a lot they can do to manage your bp and keep you comfortable and ensure baby gets everything it can from you, just listen to your body, rest, and do everything they tell you too.",
