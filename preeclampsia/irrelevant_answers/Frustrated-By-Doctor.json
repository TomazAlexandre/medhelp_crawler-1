My doctor told me to call/see L&D if something like that happened to me (and it did, but all tests came back okay and symptoms went away) but they respected me and took my concerns seriously. I felt like I was being paranoid but they told me to come in anyway to just make sure. I'm glad I did",

    "question": "Im 31+6. Yesterday and the day before I started experiencing headaches, chest pain/discomfort, rapid heart rate (120bpm), nausea, and saw gold stars. Also, my stomach has been tender. So, I went to my doctor who couldn't see me until 1pm which turned into 2pm.I had a gallbladder attack a week ago and was in the hospital. I was told it needs to have a close eye on it because it could turn into an infection or gangrene.She said my heart rate is always high when I see her and dismissed my high heart rate even though at home its usually 84bpm and 75 bpm when laying down.She then chalked everything else up to me being a bit anemic according to my hospital records. Would I not have felt this awful before?She didn't even do a urine analysis to rule out infection or preeclampsia! Which really makes me upset. I thought that was routine with any sort of symptoms like this.Should I seek a second opinion or just trust my doctor? I'm having a hard time\u00a0\u00a0trusting her as she was suppose to set me up with an OBGYN over 3 weeks ago now and it still hasn't happened. And then she gave me a free iron supplement sample that was expired!",
