            "answer": "sorry i reread your post.. you did not have preeclampsia.. but how high was your blood pressure. Now please let me reiterate something with U . I work in the medical field, but not maternity, maybe this level wouldnt be considered high for someone in your shoes. the lab value is abnormal and panic level for your normal person. I do not know if that changes in a pregnant women",

The high blood pressure that goes along with preeclamsia\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0may have led to your elavated creat level. BLood pressure is controlled by the angiotension inhibitor located in the kidney, so THe pre exsisting condition could have led to your abnormal blood work, I would think the mD would have addressed this with you, I would have it checked out. creatinine clearance is the best indicator of kidney failure",

    "question": "I recently had a baby and recieved copies of my medical records. I was induced due to high blood pressure that came on the last 3 weeks of my pregnancy. I was never diagnosed with preeclampsia or anything. Just pregnancy induced hypertension. However, I noticed on my CMP labs that my creatinine was 4.7!!! And my SGOT was raised to 47. My doctors never mentioned anything about this. Isn't the normal creatinine only up to 1.3 or something? A level this high ususually indicates kidney impairement, right?Would these two things in combination indicate developing preeclampsia? Should I be concerned regarding how high it was? Should I go to the doctors? I had a CMP done about 2 or 3 times prior to this during my pregnancy and my levels were never high then. I'm trying to figure out what it might mean. I'm kinda concerned!",
