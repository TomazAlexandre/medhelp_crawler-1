    "question": "Just looking for some reassurance! I just got home from L&D, I am having pretty regular contractions that are fairly painful, cervix is still high and not thinned very much but, dilated 1 1/2 centimeters. I have gestational diabetes and a growth scan tonight, estimated baby to be 7 pounds! This is my second pregnancy and my first child was born at 37 weeks and 7.3 pounds. Just wondering if anyone else on here has experienced something similar. My doctor is VBAC supportive\u00a0\u00a0(c-section on first pregnancy due to preeclampsia) bit I'm worried I may have to deliver early and via c-section again.",
