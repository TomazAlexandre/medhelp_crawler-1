            "answer": "Since I'm just 19 weeks they orders the test to get a baseline because I got a high BP reading. The results came in Friday morning and only the nurse was around, she said call us Monday. Preeclampsia cutoff is 300mg at 20 weeks but I was 286 at 19 and fairly hydrated. Tried to relax over the weekend but not going well. First pregnancy and partner isn't super understanding and we got into a huge fight.Once you get that 300 threshold you never go back/aren't \"cured\" until delivery right?Wish I could have relaxed and gotten stress levels under control this weekend",

    "question": "I am 19 weeks pregnant - in the doctors office my BP measured high so they ordered a blood test and a urinalysis. Protein showed up high (286 mg). I have been measuring my BP regularly outside the doctors office and it has been totally normal (and continues to be) but the high protein is making me really nervous. Does this signal that I am developing preeclampsia? I had a very stressful week, could it just be an isolated incident? I am having a hard time feeling secure waiting until Monday to speak with a specialist.",
