            "answer": "VBAC is vaginal birth after cesarean. That won't happen unless you've had a c-section and then are trying to have a second baby vaginally. If you were going to be pre-eclamptic, that would likely have shown itself already.Do not look into complications if you are a low-risk pregnancy. You'll only freak yourself out unnecessarily. You aren't due for another four days and many first time mothers go past their due date, do not worry that he isn't here yet.",

I think I've scared myself since I keep reading about all these different things that can happen, from Vbacks, to cartoons, to preeclampsia, still born, etc.. I'm having a boy and it worries me that he's still not here. I guess I just need some words of wisdom or anything that'll calm my crazy thoughts.",
