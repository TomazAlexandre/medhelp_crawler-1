    "question": "Well due date is friday and doc said yesterday im still only 1cm so induction date is set for monday at 6am. The nurse said maybe i wont need bc she thinks doc stripped some of membrane? So i guess we wait and see. They also said my cervix is still a little high, anyone else experience this? Do you think i can still have vaginal delivery if cervix is high? I had a vaginal delivery with my first and would like one with this one. I was induced with my first bc of preeclampsia.",
