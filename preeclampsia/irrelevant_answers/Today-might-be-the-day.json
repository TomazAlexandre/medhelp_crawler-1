    "question": "I have what I hope is my last prenatal OB appointment today.... on Wednesday she mentioned that she would have induced me that day but she doesn't believe in inducing before 38 weeks. She said we'd talk about induction this week so she scheduled me for today (I'm 38 weeks today). I'm hoping I get induced today or tomorrow and that she doesn't change her mind.I have gestational hypertension with preeclampsia symptoms and it's making it hard on me. When I go grocery shopping I have to sit halfway through because my heart starts racing and my vision gets blurry and I get dizzy. She seems to be taking me seriously but I'm worried since I've been preparing myself mentally all weekend to have the baby any day now and I feel like I'll be crushed if she changed her mind.",
