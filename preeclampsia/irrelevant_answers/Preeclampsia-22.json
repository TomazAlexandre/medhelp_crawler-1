They told me to rush to the hospital to be monitored and another test was done to check my urine and no protein was found along with negative results in blood work drawn to check my liver enzymes, kidneys,& blood clotting. Thank the Lord.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure was back down as well. So they ruled out Preeclampsia and said I have gestational hypertension and immediately I was put on bed rest. So I pray for you and your health and the health of your baby :)",
