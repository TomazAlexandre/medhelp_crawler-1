            "answer": "I had placenta previa with 2 of 5 of my pregnanies. They told me no sex or anything strenuous until it corrected itself. The reason is because it is easy to spot and bleed when the placenta is over the cervix. With both pregnancies the previa had corrected itself and moved off the cervix by my 18-20 week sonogram. It is pretty common early on to have low lying placenta but usually it corrects itself and doesn't cause much problem.",

    "question": "Im 10 weeks pregnant and have had an almost perfect pregnancy. I have had 2 c-section in the past 3 years and 1 miscarriage a few months ago. I started to spot and cramp yesterday and it has continued today. I went to my Doctor and she did an ultrasound and said the baby looked great but that my placenta was over my cervix. She didn't sound to concerned about it though and never really told me why im spotting or cramping. Im very worried. My mom had 3 placenta previas. Could this spotting and cramping be because of the low lying placenta or is it something else? I have also had my two children early (33 and 35 weeks) because of severe preeclampsia and pre-term labor. I was hoping that maybe someone could give me some insight on this.Thank you- Tiffany",
