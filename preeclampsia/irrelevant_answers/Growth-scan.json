            "answer": "I was measuring 2 weeks ahead at both 32 and 34 weeks and was sent for a scan to check on babys size and general health. The scan showed baby was within the 76th percentile for the estimated gestational age in relation to size. I think they just like to double check sometimes as fundal height is only a rough guide.I also had elevated blood pressure at my 37 week check up although once I had a lie down for a few minutes it had dropped considerably. My midwife tested my urine for protein and there wasn't any although she said it is normal to find traces of protein in urine during a healthy pregnancy. I'm not sure why one of your doctors was more concerned than the other?! Tests can't hurt I suppose - for peace of mind at least. Headaches or flashing/blurry vision and swelling of feet and hands can be symptoms of preemclampsia. Have you had any symptoms? Good luck with the tests! From what you have said I think you'll be fine.",

    "question": "So at my appointment today my fundal was measuring two weeks ahead so my dr wants to do a growth scan. Now this is very odd to me because two weeks ago I went to a place for fun to have a 4d sonogram and they told me my baby was measuring a week behind... has anyone ever measures ahead for their fundal and behind for there babies growth??? Or maybe my baby had a growth spurt in the last two weeks? If anyone has experienced anything like this id like to hear the result! And also I'm at the later stages in my pregnancy 35 weeks so I have been seeing a new dr every visit because they want me to meet them all incase my dr can't be there for the delivery. Now at my last appointment two weeks ago I had a very experienced dr and there was trace amounts of protien in my urine and my blood pressure was slightly elevated. I asked him if I could have pre eclampsia and he said no there would be protien in my urine, trace amounts are normal, and then he took my blood pressure again for me while I was laying down and it came back normal. So at my appointment today with a different less experienced dr everything was the same trace protien and blood pressure slightly elevated and she seemed very concerned and is sending me for more tests for preeclampsia. I'm just curious as to why one dr would not be the least but concerned and another one would??? Anyways it's just got me worried",
