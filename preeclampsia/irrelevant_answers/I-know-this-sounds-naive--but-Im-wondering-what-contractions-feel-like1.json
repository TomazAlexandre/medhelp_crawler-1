            "answer": "Hi there.\u00a0\u00a0The tightening of the tummy does indeed sound like labor pains.\u00a0\u00a0At least those are very much what mine felt like.\u00a0\u00a0If they are not overly painful, and inconsistent in timing, chances are it is braxton hicks, or \"practice contractions\".\u00a0\u00a0Your body is starting to get ready!!Real contractions tend to be fairly regular and begin to intensify pain wise (don't worry, it's not horrible!).\u00a0\u00a0They also do not go away, but start coming closer and closer together.If you are even remotely concerned, do not hesitate to take a trip to L&D, or to call your Dr.\u00a0\u00a0If your water breaks, it is recommended you go to L&D to be checked.\u00a0\u00a0Also, most Dr.s recommend coming in when labor pains are about 5 minutes apart and are intense.\u00a0\u00a0I sort of think of it like a wave.\u00a0\u00a0They begin, increase and peak, then decrease with a break in between.The menstural type cramping you are experiencing is likely what is called round ligament pain.\u00a0\u00a0Ligaments in your body stretching and pulling as baby is big now.\u00a0\u00a0It's very common and very normal.But again, remember your Dr. works for you, and do not worry about calling or going to L&D too often.\u00a0\u00a0I went in several times in my final weeks as I had contractions for about 2 weeks before I went into \"hard labor\".\u00a0\u00a0I always recommend erring on the side of caution.Congrats to you!\u00a0\u00a0I wish you a healthy and easy delivery.\u00a0\u00a0So exciting!!",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your replies, ladies.So here's the update:We went into Labor and Delivery and turns out I WAS contracting and the contractions were only 1 minute apart! But then I'd have a 10 minute stretch where I didn't have any. And then another 10 minute stretch where they were 1 minute apart. They checked me and I had dilated a LITTLE (just to a 1.\u00a0\u00a0But yesterday at the doctor's I wasn't dilated at all.). But when she checked me again in an hour, my dilation hadn't changed, so they told me to come home.\u00a0\u00a0She actually told me that if I had dilated more - even to a two, then they would have kept me there!\u00a0\u00a0Also, she could feel the baby's head!!\u00a0\u00a0SO exciting!!",

But I went because I knew I had a scheduled scsection and I stay about 35 minutes form the hospital I didnt want to wait. But I wasnt dilated or anything so that was good. They gave me terbutaline each time to stop my contractions. And my pain wa mostly in my back, the came to my stomach were it got tight.How are you making it on bedrest? How has your blood pressure been?So you are due around the 10th of Nov, that was my origainal due date but he will csection me on Nov 3, I will be 39 weeks then",
