Except I'm not at risk but if I eat or drink anything she says \"are you sure that's okay for the baby?\" It's so annoying, and I finally just nicely but firmly told her that if it wasn't okay I wouldn't be doing it. And if I'm concerned about something I'll talk to my doctor about it.",

Granted she is both mine and my sister's OB and fabulous. Lol. I think if you explain that not eating isn't going to help you or baby then maybe she will lay off.",

You just have to try seeing it from her point of view. Really, she wants what's best for you and you'll always be her little girl, especially when your pregnant. Wait til the baby gets here hahahaha - I had to move out of state with my first (no lie) just to get the hell away from her!! Not that I don't love her but jeeeze!! Now that my first is 5,I think my mom is FINALLY starting to come around and backing off. :-/ good luck hun!!",

    "question": "I'm 14 weeks and my ob said I'm at risk for preeclampsia and now if I eat ANYTHING, my mom flips out completely talking about how I'm going to kill myself and so on, whenever she should just be happy that I'm attempting to eat since I throw up everything. I can seriously eat some carrot sticks, and she'll go ballistic. I know that I'm at risk, and my doctor clearly outlined to me what's safe to eat, and what I should stay away from. How do I get her to back off? I think she still thinks I'm a little girl, but I don't want to hurt her feelings. Please help.",
