How long does the swelling last and does it get better if you drink water and prop up your legs?The symptoms you listed were my symptoms and I had stage 2 pre eclampsia. I was induced at 36 weeks because of it.",

            "answer": "Yes to the blurred vision/black spots. I can make a happy face out of my skin when my legs swell. It's very frequent come night time. And propping them up helps a little. Water has been tough to keep down these last few days because of the headache. I've been so nauseous, and have been in the doctors office the last three days this week, still no answers. Low platelets and glucose level wouldn't cause this much trouble! Preeclampsia is famous in our family..and I know whole heartedly this is what it is! The medical team I have to deal with though is completely idiotic.",

Baby is healthy and that's great! But how am I suppose to keep her healthy when I can't take care of myself at this point. So much to rant about, sorry!",
