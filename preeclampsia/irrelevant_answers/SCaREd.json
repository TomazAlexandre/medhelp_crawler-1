            "answer": "I've had that in my first pregnancy (last year) and it luckily didnt lead to me getting pre-eclampsia, but, it did make my doctor decide to induce me at 38 weeks since I had already gone into pre term labor at 36 weeks. Unfortunately, my blood pressure did also result in me having to go to the obgyn more frequently than most preggy women for ultrasounds and stress test at the hospital to ensure the safety of baby and I.Best wishes and congrats on the pregnancy. ..you and baby will be fine, so, try not to worry much...baby will definitely get to develop until full term at least.",
