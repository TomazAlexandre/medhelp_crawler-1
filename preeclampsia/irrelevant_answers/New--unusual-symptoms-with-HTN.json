            "answer": "jelly, you poor thing, you're so educated on your condition but you still went all those hours of malignant HTN but didn't get to the ER? They'd give you IV meds to bring you down right away. I hope you're okay, along with your brain, eyes, kidney and heart after that episode. Maybe it was vasculitis, but the underlying cause isn't as important as preventing the acute damage from the malignant BP.",

    "question": "As background, I have a known asymptomatic mitral valve prolapse; history of preeclampsia and HELLP Syndrome during first pregnancy with recurring preeclampsia during second pregnancy; HTN since first pregnancy (1999), but otherwise pretty healthy.About 4 years ago, I had a full work up to rule out renal stenosis and pheochromocytoma.\u00a0\u00a0Endo hear bruits and I had BP which would go from one end of the spectrum to the other in short period of time causing dizziness, light-headedness and near syncope.\u00a0\u00a0BP was eventually stabilized but high levels of\u00a0\u00a0protein were found in\u00a0\u00a024 hour urine.\u00a0\u00a0Endo rule out pheo and renal stenosis but never accounted for the bruits.About 2 months ago I had a kindey infection and potassium deficiency which were treated and I have recovered.My \"normal\" BP is around 140/90.\u00a0\u00a0This is actually my goal BP since when it drops much lower I get dizzy and light headed.\u00a0\u00a0On a couple of prior ocassions, I have been to the ER with severe BP, headaches and light sensitivity and each time I was told it was migraines aggravating BP.Then, a few days ago, I had a very severe headache- worse than any I've ever had- which I initally assumed was a migraine.\u00a0\u00a0Despite migraine meds it got worse and worse so I decided to check my BP.\u00a0\u00a0It was 256/180.\u00a0\u00a0I took an extra dose of BP med (Norvasc) hoping to bring it down.\u00a0\u00a0I spent the next 28 hours layed out on the sofa, unable to move because every movement made the pain worse.\u00a0\u00a0The pain was also on the right side of my neck and I had pain on my right side near my kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0I have had kidney stones in the past and this was nowehre near that severe-\u00a0\u00a0more of a dull pain- but definitely the kidney area.Yesterday, BP was finally coming down (after 2 days of being extremely elevated) but it is still not back to baseline.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I am having pain in my mid-upper back (between shoulder blades) which is searing, but comes and goes.\u00a0\u00a0When it comes it is severe and then kinda \"fades away.\"\u00a0\u00a0Then, it comes back in a few minutes- almost like in waves.\u00a0\u00a0It is NOT muscular or spinal pain.\u00a0\u00a0It is deeper inside.\u00a0\u00a0Through all of this ordeal, I have also been having tingling and numbness in my arms and legs which feels like it is moving down my body.Right now, headache is gone but back pain is here.\u00a0\u00a0Arms and legs still tingling.\u00a0\u00a0BP at last check was 172/130.So, now I need to know if anyone has",
