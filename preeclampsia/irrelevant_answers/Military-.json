    "question": "my husband just left for army basic training last Monday, so he's still in reception. But my doctor has been running tests because he thinks i may have preeclampsia because my blood pressure has been insanely high lately. If I get induced and have the baby before I know what unit and his mailing address and all that good stuff, how would I get ahold of him? Or someone who could tell him? I think he deserves to know when his son is being born.",
