            "answer": "her lungs are mature. dr said probably because she was being stressed from all of the medical complications. apparently stress makes the lungs mature faster. she's in a regular nursery, and can room in with us. hasn't yet, since the first night i was being observed and in L&D instead of mother/baby ward. last night i was still too medicated and tired. she's been with us all day, but i may send her back to nursery so we can sleepas far as nursing... she's too sleepy and small to latch on, so when it comes to feeding they;re treating her like a preemie. i just tried pumping, and we actually got something, so at least i know she'll get the nourishment she needs.as far as pain... i've felt better, but it's not unbearable. i'm alternating motrin and percoset (no more morphine:) i can walk around, but bending is not gonna happen for a while. dr said today should be the worst as far as pain, and it should get better after this point.thanks for the pointers on preemie clothes. nothing we bought fits!ImmortalOne- my understanding is that the epidural is similar in procedure to spinal. i had a terrible, authentic needle phobia prior to this pregnancy. i've gotten very good and learned many self-relaxation techniques, but i still don't like needles. the spinal was far from the worst part. like i said, to me, getting the IV was worse! there was definitely no pain associated with getting the spinal. it;s exactly as they say. you feel the ***** from the local anesthetic, then all you feel is pressure when they give you the actual spinal. in fact, mine was done by a resident instead of the doctor (teaching hospital). i could have insisted on the attending, but everyone was so reassuring, including my doctor who was right there, that i agreed.thanks for your comments, thoughts, and prayers. we all hope to go home friday!",

    "question": "Hi everyone! Turns out I had preeclampsia and we had to have an emergency c-section on monday. i was 36 weeks. in addition to my high blood pressure and edema, i had a lot of protein in my urine. when i got to the hospital on monday, the protein levels were +4. luckily, my platelet levels had gone up a little since friday, so we were able to do a spinal instead of general anesthesia. sonogram monday morning showed that the placenta had continued to age since we last saw it on thursday, so even if my blood and urine tests had been better, we would have had to deliver in the next week. last thursday she was estimated to weigh 5 lbs 6 oz, but she was born 4 lbs 13 oz. she's tiny! but she's doing very well!!! the only trouble she is having is slight difficulty regulating body temp. we haven't had success breast feeding yet, but i will meet with the lactation specialist today. because of my high bp, i had to spend an extra 24 hrs on the L&D floor for careful monitoring and to receive meds to prevent seizures. (by the way... i heard magnesium sulfate is supposed to be pretty rough, but i tolerated it very well... only side effect was being a little flushed). all of the meds had me very out of it, so dh spent more time with the baby than i did.i am now in a regular mother/baby unit, and hope to spend more time with her today. she sleeps a lot, so it's very calming. in fact, everytime i try to bf, she just passes out. if all goes well, we'll heqd home friday, after which i am sure i will post many questions about infant care!!Notes about my delivery:~labor and delivery and maternity nurses are AMAZING people~getting spinal was not too bad! (and this is coming from someone with a needle phobia). i personally felt more uncomfortable getting the IV put in",
