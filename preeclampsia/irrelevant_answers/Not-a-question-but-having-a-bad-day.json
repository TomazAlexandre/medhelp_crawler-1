Anyways, I have a 2 year old and today he isn't listening. He was up most of the night. I got 2 hours of sleep and even our 2 dogs are not behaving. My husband and teenage son have men's bible study tonight\u00a0\u00a0(which I want them to go) but I feel like poop. My back where my kidneys are hurt bad. When the baby moves it really hurts. I know I shouldn't complain but it has been a day.My toddler got into my husbands bible case and got his highlights. He drew all over himself (after he had a bath of course. Couldn't do it before). There is highlights on carpet. I just am ready for this day to be over.Thank you for letting me rant.",
