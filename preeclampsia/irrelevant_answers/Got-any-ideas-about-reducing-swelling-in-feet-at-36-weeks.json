Here are some tips for relieving and managing this swelling:Relieve the pressure. Put your feet up on a footstool or hassock, or lie on your side. This will relieve the pressure on the veins of your lower body and reduce the swelling. Take breaks during the day where you can sit with your feet up. While you sleep, raise your legs slightly with pillows. Don",

It's funny you should bring this up, because my feet have already outgrown all my shoes, and I had to go shopping today for a new pair...luckily I found a pair of Aerosole brand shoes in a wide!As for your feet, my sister had preeclampsia with her first child and swelled up until she looked like the Michelin Man, and she would soak her feet in something called Johnson's Foot Soap (found in the foot care section at Wal-Mart and Target). She said it DEFINITELY helped revive her feet...not so much the swelling, but the achiness, soreness, and overall discomfort.For swelling, she bought bottles of Witch Hazel and would literally soak a couple of washcloths in the stuff, then lay the cloths over her feet while propping them up. This would take up a lot of Witch Hazel, so get generic brand if possible since you'll go through a bottle pretty quickly. Sometimes, she would get a small foot basin and pour about half a bottle of Witch Hazel in, then add enough cool (not totally cold) water to soak her feet (this was during the very last, miserable days of her pregnancy, which was in late August! LOL).Either way, the Witch Hazel worked well for her...Just another something you can try! Let me know if you try it, and if it works for you, because I'll probably be trying it myself in a few months! LOLGood luck!",
