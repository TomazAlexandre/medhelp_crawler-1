            "answer": "I've went to the er last friday and they said I need to drink more water. I was having contrations the whole time but didnt dialate any so they sent me home. I have drank so much water the past two days and my swelling is still bad. I called the doctor today and they told me to check my blood pressure and if its not over 130/90 then just get bed rest, it was 120/80. When I do have bed rest the swelling goes down but I can get up to just go to the bathroom and it swells so bad fast. Im just worried.",

            "answer": "Swelling can be common in pregnancy and you can be retaining water. You do have symptoms of pre eclampsia,\u00a0\u00a0but you are missing 2 key factors, high blood pressure and protein in your urine. I would just keep your doctor up to date on how you feel, weight gain and I am sure they will watch you close and check you often for your bp and any protein.",

My blood pressure has been rising since I was 20 weeks and I've been around 142/86. They're watching me but no bed rest yet thankfully.",
