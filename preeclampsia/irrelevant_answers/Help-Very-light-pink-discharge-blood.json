    "question": "Hi ladies,So lately I have had a rough time in my relationship and I'm not sure if this might be the cause. I am a high risk patient for preeclampsia so I get high blood pressure very easy over stressful things. It's easy said \"relax and rest\" but I have never been that type to just relax and rest. Yesterday morning I had a little bit of pinky discharge on my underwear liner and I only notice it when I wipe. I am on my last med for thrush as well and not sure if that might be why this pinky discharge is there? Sorry if TMI but please what should I do??",
