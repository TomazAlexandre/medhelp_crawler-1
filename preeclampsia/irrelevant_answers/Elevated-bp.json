    "question": "I'm almost 36 weeks and I have anxiety so many times when I go to the doctors my blood pressure is elevated or slightly high. But starts to go down once I sit down and chill and de-stress myself about a doctor's appointment. I don't have any symptoms of preeclampsia just the blood pressure thing.... Anyone else experience this?? And the other things I'm dealing with I think are normal pregnancy things like fatigue, back pain, pee a lot, and I get an upset stomach in the morning because I'm hungry and any other time during the day when I'm hungry. Today at my appointment I was worked up because on the ride in I almost got pushed off the road by a tractor trailer and like I said I get anxious when I have appointments so like I thought it would be it was high it was 162/100 and then 10-15 mins later was 150/87 and they told me to take it later so I took it at 8 tonight and it was 136/83 which is in the average range anyone else experience this or have any advice it just scares me to think something could potentially be wrong.... The doctor didn't say she was concerned just said to keep an eye on it for the week until my next appointment and call if the bottom number stayed above 90.... Helpppp",
