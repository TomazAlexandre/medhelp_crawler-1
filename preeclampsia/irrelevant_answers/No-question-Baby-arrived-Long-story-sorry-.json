    "question": "jaxson Thomas has made his way into the world on 11/17/14. 3 months premature. I went into the doctor for a regular visit on 11/13. They told me my blood pressure and protien count was really high. I was going into the severe preeclampsia stage. Rushed me by ambulance to a hospital 45 minutes away to keep a better eye on baby and monitor my blood pressure. I was so annoyed because I felt fine the entire time, no other symptoms other than my Bp. I sat In a hospital bed worrying about if my baby was ok. All nurses giggled at him because they couldn't keep him on the heart rate monitors Cuz he moved and wiggled constantly. So they kept giving me meds after meds do my high Bp over the weekend. Sunday night my fianc\u00e9 had to go back home to go to work Monday. I hated for him to leave but I was just sitting In a bed and doc told me it was for the remainder of the pregnancy! 3 months in a bed?! I was really upset. Nurse came in to check Jaxson, his heart rate had been dipping, dropping down for a few minutes and coming back up. The sweetest nurse Olivia said it would be a good idea to call my fianc\u00e9 and family back in since the doctor might have me deliver. I had never been more scared in my life. Monday night @ 10:42 via c section Jaxson Thomas made his way here. 1lb 12oz. Beautiful baby boy. I know we have such a long road with him in the nicu but he is doing great so far! I had gotten the best care needed for jax. Doctors are positive for him and pleased with where he's at right now. My heart breaks for him but I'm trying to be strong. Please say a prayer for my baby and family as we continue on this long journey to get jax home. Thanks!!",
