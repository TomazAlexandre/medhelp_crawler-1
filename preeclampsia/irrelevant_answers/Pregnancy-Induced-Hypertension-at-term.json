            "answer": "Hi- I had PIT from about 6/7 months on. but never developed to preeclampsia. they have to test the protein in your urine before they can tell you that!If you don't have the protein, you are not pre eclamptic (at least from what my ob told me) and in my own experience.I was induced two times - one at 38 weeks- didnt happen and got sent home and one a week later. never worked either- ended up w/ a c-section. BUT everything is fine and I have a healthy 3yr old son.Just keep yourself relaxed and stay put. Don't go to work if you work...take early leave if you can and dont do laundry, dishes, cleaning..cooking..just RELAX.That is what I had to do from 7 months on.And after delivery my BP went back down.Best of luck to you!",

            "answer": "Same thing here. I am at 33 weeks and I fell absolutely fine. After a scan yesterday, they found my placenta to be older than it should be. I am now on bed rest and on a diet. Just the other day my DH was saying how great my pregnancy has been so far. I had to agree as up until yesterday I was at school and felt fine.Good luck and let us know how it goes. I don't want to be induced either, but if is it something that needs to be done for the baby, then who am I to argue.",

    "question": "Well, I just had my 38 week appt. and my bp's were high.\u00a0\u00a0I had to stay to do serial bp reading for almost and hour.\u00a0\u00a0They kept flucuating from 140's/90's to 130's/80's.\u00a0\u00a0They said it doesn't appear that I have preeclampsia but just transient or pregnancy induced hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0They did an NST on the baby and she is fine.\u00a0\u00a0But I have to do a 24 urine collection so they can watch my protein and be on modified bedrest.\u00a0\u00a0They said once they get the results from my urine and blood work they'll go from there.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully my little one will decide to make her appearence before I get that far!\u00a0\u00a0Tomorrows a full moon so you never know :o)Isn't it crazy how you can go your entire pregnancy without one complication and the last 2 weeks you get something like this?!\u00a0\u00a0I just hope they don't have to induce me because of it.",
