Well today they said my blood pressure jumped a lot higher than normal so i have to do a 24 hour urine collection and a bunch of blood tests. my other symptoms have been cramping and nasty feeling in my stomach when i dont eat i just noticed during my nonstress test when i tried to focus on anything close to me my vision went blurry. has anybody had anything like this? could it just come on that fast because everything was normal tuesday besides gaining 2 pounds since friday now i gained 2 more since tuesday and its thursday and i do not want to have to go on bedrest. please tell me anything imm worried and my doctor didnt even see me just the nurse and she did not say a lot about it",
