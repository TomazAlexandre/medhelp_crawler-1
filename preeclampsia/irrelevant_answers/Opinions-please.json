    "question": "im 29 weeks and lately my heart has been racing after every meal. Especially when drinking milk. When I was about 8 weeks my blood pressure was sky high. My mom had preeclampsia with all four of her pregnancies and even my grandma had heart problems. I mentioned it to my doctor months ago but he wasn't too concerned about it because I wasn't as far along which is when they usually detect me. Now that I'm going on 30 weeks and it's become a daily thing it really scares me! Any one have preeclampsia or could give me some reassurance?",
