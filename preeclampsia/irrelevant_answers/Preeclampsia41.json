            "answer": "Well definitely try to eat better. Cut down on salt and extra sauces that aren't needed to flavor foods. Cut down on fast food. Eat more fresh veggies and fruits. Going for light walks and staying active can help too. I was almost preeclamptic with my first but thankfully I went into labor before my doctor decided to admit me to the hospital.",

    "question": "I had preeclampsia with my last baby (born June 3, 2014) and I'm about 7 weeks pregnant. I'm terrified of getting it again. I was diagnosed with it at 35 weeks. I delivered my son and he was in the NICU for 8 days. I've read that if it was severe and early there is more of a risk, but if it was later and less severe there's a 20% rate of reoccurance. I gained 50 pounds with my first. I have been trying to eat better since I found out. I ate like crap the first time. I also didn't take prenatal a because iron made me sick but I'm going to try this time. I'm just so terrified of having it again and getting another bad Doctor. Is there any mom who has had it with their first & been okay with the second? Just to give me a tad bit of excitement rather than creeping fear.",
