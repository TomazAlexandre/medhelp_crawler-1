            "answer": "i am definitely pleased that they have caught this early but have felt a little alone this pregnancy, in my 31 week appointment my midwife seemed more interested in a sofa she wanted to buy than my concerns for my delivery that i was trying to voice.Although I know this has been picked up early i think it could have been picked up earlier if she had measured me correctly.I shouldnt dwell - negative energy -keeping calm & taking each day as it comes is positive :)",

    "question": "So my story isn't completely finished yet but i wantex to jot it all down for you all so i didn't forget anything.So a bit of background is that i have had the most unremarkable pregnancy, i wasnt overweight when i conceived, i had no symptoms until i was 28 weeks & started showing.The only symptoms ive had since have been tiredness, feeling dehydrated, back pain, slight headache & generally feeling heavier from carrying around my little bundle. Everyone who commented on my pregnancy commented on how small i am - how i did not look as far gone as i am etc.So now to get to today. I am 34+1 & attended my midwife appointment.Urine sample showing high levels of protein (which they told me when i saw them at 31 weeks, but they werent worried about this).Blood pressure was high - which initially she was not worried about.But then the feel of my tummy to measure her. - At this point alarm bells started ringing with me & her as it was showing that baby had not grown since 31 weeks.So I was told to go to the maternity day unit to 1. Have a scan 2. Have a heart monitor for baby & 3. To measure blood pressure over a period of time.I had my scan not long after i arrived; which was worse than initially expected - at this point my little girl i healthy but she is small - she is measuring at 29 weeks & 3.5lbs.After a midwife has completed my blood pressure she informs me that i will be taken to the delivery suite as i need some medication to reduce my blood pressure.At this point a consultant comes to speak to me to advise as to what will happen next. I am informed i have preeclampsia, that my liver & kidneys arent working as they should be & that there is a problem with my blood count. But the main priority right now is to reduce my blood pressure.I am then given my first steriod injection to help with the babys lungs as they now tell me that they plan on delivering my baby through c section before the end of the week (this is not helping my blood pressure).I know im in the best place - i just cannot rest right now. Atm my blood pressure has stabilised & they have checked my urine & there is less protein showing (both good signs).Over the next few days they will 1. Give me another steroid injection, my last one to make sure babys lungs will be developed whenever they decide to deliver her.2. They will check my blood again to see at what rate my blood count is decreasing.3. They will continue to monitor my blood pressure.So.. i really do hope no one is going through this or anything dramatic right now, but i feel optimistic, we can do this together :)",
