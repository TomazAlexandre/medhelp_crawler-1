He's just not the one that has to be pregnant and deliver a baby while dealing with the horrible symptoms I deal with on a daily basis. I don't think he truly understands what I go through. I appreciate you all's support, it makes it easier for me to do what is best for me even though it isn't what I would do if I were 'normal'. It is so hard sometimes to deal with being sick all the time. I hate my chiari and the way it is controlling my life :(",

    "question": "So I am wondering if getting pregnant with a chiari malformation (pre-op) is dangerous? I have four miscarriages (that I know of) before I conceived my daughter Gracelon in August 2007, I had some complications with her and was on bedrest for almost the entire pregnancy and ended up with preeclampsia with her as well. She was a pitocin/epidural vag. delivery with no complications really. I was then told I'd be lucky to get pregnant again without medical help because it had been so hard to get Gracie. So we counted ourselves blessed and didn't think about whether we would have more or not cause we were just so happy to have her. (On a side note I had worse symptoms from my unknown at the time Chiari after her delivery, the first time I really started to think I might have MS) Then in January 2010 we very unexpectedly conceived our second daughter Kaylee. I had some complications with her in the first trimester, about 13 weeks I had a severe bleeding spell like water breaking but not...it was tacked up to a low lying placenta, I was put on bedrest and pelvic rest till 20 weeks. At that check-up they did another ultrasound and found that the placenta had moved up and she was thriving. I ended up firing two OB's and hired a midwife and had my daughter in the comfort of my home on Sept. 25, 2010. Right after her birth I relapsed into the worst symptoms I've ever experienced! I couldn't even handle breastfeeding her because it was literally killing me. I couldn't move or function until I stopped nursing her and switched to formula...then I was able to move some without feeling like death was knocking on my door. So in December 2010 I gave in and went to see a doctor for my symptoms that I thought was maybe MS, I was referred to a NL and he did a CT scan to rule out a tumor and MS....I found out recently he should have done an MRI but that's in the past and I can't go back and make him do one lol. So he tacked my symptoms up to Fibromyalgia and I quit seeing him because I felt the dx was a cop out. So I was due for another brain scan this past December but didn't get it due to lack of $ and insurance. After the minor car accident in February I asked my chiropractor to order a scan for peace of mind. He had an MRI done on me on March 22 and that is when I found out about my CM.Sorry for all that, just wanted to give you some background to my history. Now on to the point of this post. I haven't been to see a NS or NL since finding out I have a CM. I have pretty severe symptoms on most days...sometimes I am lucky and have some pretty nice days here and there. My husband really wants another baby, our girls are 4 (May 17) and 19 months (will be 2 the end of Sept.). I don't mind either way...I am really on the fence about it even without the chiari being considered. I am happy with my little girls and wouldn't mind having just them. On the other hand I wouldn't mind having one more (but that would be it! I'm done at three lol). Now I just sent my MRI to a NS in Michigan and awaiting her opinion on my scan. I'm truly hoping she will give me some kind of answer on what I can do to stop these horrible symptoms. Who knows...she may say I should have the surgery soon or she may say I don't need it at this time. I can't say for sure. My question is...should we try for another baby now or wait or what? I've told my husband we need to wait, but then at the same time I kind of want to try for one more. I just don't know what to do and I guess I am just wanting you all's opinion on the matter.I am so so sorry this is so long, this is just something we've been debating on for a while now. Thanks for any input/advice on this delicate matter. :)",
