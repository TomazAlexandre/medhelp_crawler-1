    "question": "In a nutshell, I was experiencing horrible chest pain and thought it was just acid reflux but the pain was no responding to ANY medication I took. After a visit to the doctors, L&D to be checked for preeclampsia and two visits to the ER in ONE day, they finally convinced me to get a CT scan. What the were figuring is a possible blood clot, but what they found was actually a medistinial mass (tumor) located just behind my sternum the size of an orange. The doctor said it may have been growing for up to 5 years and The only reason I am finding out is because the baby is growing and pressing everything upwards causing the chest pain I am experiencing.The pain went away several days later but returned this last weekend with vengeance! I doubled up on the Norcos that were prescribed to me the first time in the ER, but it did nothing. I felt like my breast bones were slowly cracking every time I took a breathe, my jaw and teeth with aching and everything from my ribs up to the back of my head steadily pulsed and throbbed. It was excruciating! Went back to the ER and after a dose of dilauted, 1000mg of acetaminophen via IV drop and morphine, I was finally able to lean back against a chair without excruciating pain. I'm not currently on morphine and Tylenol regimen when I feel the pain coming on, however the past 48 hours have been pain free again.My worst fear is that this pain is going to return and the next time we go to the ER, they will not be able to control it forcing me into an emergency C-section that I more than likely would need to be put under full general anesthesia in order to have because I would not be able to lay down for the procedure. The thought of our son being born that way and in such a stressful, sterile environment instead of being able to be placed on my chest immediately following his birth for comfort and warmth is just heartbreaking. So given this information, we have decided to proceed with an early delivery at 35 weeks. Luckily he is measuring on the bigger side, so we feel he will not need any NICU time and I have been leaking colostrum for about 2 months already, so hopefully my milk comes in quickly after.After the birth, I will go into surgery for the tumor which is a very invasive similar to open heart in which they will need to break apart my chest bones to remove the tumor with s 6-8 week recovery. During that time they will test the tumor for cancer. If it is benign, this nightmare can all be put behind us and we can just love our little boy like crazy. If it is malignant, then we will proceed with IVF egg retrieval as both radiation and chemo will be required and the chemo will kill any chance we have of a second child otherwise.Despite all that is in front of us, I am so excited to meet this little boy and having this upcoming life changing experience has been a beautiful distraction for the fear of the unknown yet to come. The fact that according to the doctors, I may have never known about the tumor for possibly 10 or so years down the road unless this little blessing came along when he did, is something I don't know if I will ever be able to fully embrace, especially if it does come back malignant. This little boy is protecting his Mommy already, and I'm already so grateful for him.Keep us in your thoughts and prayers please as we embark on this crazy journey as first time parents to our little Austin James!!",
