I was so swollen with my first daughter I could feel the fluid JIGGLING on the top of my feet; is that how bad yours is? I didn't have Pre-E or BP issues.If your doctor was concerned about Pre-E they would take it very seriously. I'd just relax and keep those piggies elevated as much as humanly possible and drink loads of water!",

            "answer": "With my 3rd pregnancy I was so swollen in my legs that most of my jeans didn't fit.\u00a0\u00a0I could gently lay my hand on my thigh for a few seconds and when I moved it I had a perfect indent of my hand.\u00a0\u00a0If you are on your feet most of the day, it stands to reason that you are going to have a good amount of swelling in your lower extremities. It also sounds like from your post you have BP issues sometimes anyway.\u00a0\u00a0As long as your doctor is aware of what you have posted s/he will monitor any signs that may indicate Pre-E. As for white blood cell count, that could have simply been from your body trying to fight off a common cold.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you work during the day you need to take a few minutes every couple of hours to relax and lift your feet, preferably some place you can lay down and elevate them above your heart, but if you can't then sittign in a chair and propping them in another chair would be good as well.\u00a0\u00a0If you have to stand for prolonged periods, if possible, have a stool that you can alternate propping your foot up on.I had pretty bad swelling with most of my pregnancies, never really had bp issues, but did have a problem with one of them where I had a small amount of protein in my urine and had to do the 24 hour urine but I never developed pre-e.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck, just make sure your doctor is informed on all your symptoms and s/he should let you know if there's anything to worry about.",

I'm just afraid with everything i've been experiencing it's going to turn into something bad and quickly.\u00a0\u00a0I guess you can't really prevent it if it is though and hopefully i'm far enough along that if he had to be born early he'd be ok.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing my doctor is concerned about is my bp but she just doesn't seem to get that i have white coat symdrome...it's always been elevated at the doctors. I get my self so worked up going in there.\u00a0\u00a0But i have had some elevation at home also which is the part that scares me. I'm afraid the spikes are doing damage to the baby.",

With my son again i was in hospital being monitored, my blood pressure was so high they put me on delivery suite, they were monitoring me and my sons heart rate dropped to 44 beats per minute so i got rushed straight into theatre.The main 3 signs of pre-eclampsia are high blood pressure, protein in your urine and swelling, i got all 3 at the same time. Pre-eclampsia is scary but it can be picked up easily. Try not to worry about it too much and if you do get worried get your doc just to check your blood pressure and urine.Hope this helpsI hope the last of your pregnancy goes smoothly for you.",

    "question": "Hi,Just wanted to run down the symtoms i've been having since about 19 weeks pregnant and hoping that someone with experience with pre-eclampsia can help me out.\u00a0\u00a0Since 19 weeks i've been having pretty major swelling mainly in my legs. Now at 30 weeks it's starting to move down to my ankles and feet.\u00a0\u00a0It's worse when i work all day and usually by morning after sleeping all night it's mostly gone.\u00a0\u00a0Lately also i've been having really weird blood pressure readings...some days it's perfectly fine while others days i have spikes of high pressure ie 160/90 or such.\u00a0\u00a0It never stays high long and usually withing 20 minutes to a half hour at the most it's closer to normal again.\u00a0\u00a0I also have white coat symdrome so i always get a high reading at the doctors which is why i monitor it home myself.\u00a0\u00a0Other then that i feel ok...i'm very very tired and have been most of this pregnancy..baby is moving well. I'm just really worried.\u00a0\u00a0I've never had any protein in my urine that my doctor told me about anyway. She did blood work a couple of days ago to check liver and kidney function and i haven't heard from her yet so i'm hoping it was ok.\u00a0\u00a0At 24 weeks my white blood cell count was elevated..is this a sign of pre-eclampsia? I'm just so confused and scared. I'm always checking my pressure because i'm paranoid it's going to spike really high and do damage to me or the baby. If anyone can give me some advice or tell me their experience with this i would really appreciate it.Thanks in advance",
