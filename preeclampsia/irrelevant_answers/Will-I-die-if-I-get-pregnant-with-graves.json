            "answer": "Thanks for responding so quickly barb. I was feeling fine on my PTU until about a month ago, when my heart started acting up again, I went to my cardiologist (easier to get in to see them than my endo) and they ordered a thyroid test. I didn't realize how ontop of my own labs I should be, so I just quickly jotted down what the nurse on the phone told me, I'm not sure what any of it means, but the lab results got me in to see my endo a few months earlier than my normal appointment (which was in december of this year). I see my endo on the 9th of sept. And I will ask for a print out of my labs. Right now all I have is this messy note I made of what the nurse told me:TSH normal 5.0 (0.34-5.60)3T3 normal 2.9 (2.3-4.2)T4 0.56 (0.61-1.12)She said it wasn't terrible, but with my symptoms bothering me I couldn't wait until december to be seen. I was first on 50mg PTU twice a day, and then uped to 50mg PTU three times a day. When I had to take 3 pills, I ended up forgetting the 3rd pill almost every time. Also, it was making my hair fall out like crazy so I was not pushing myself to remember. I've learned my lesson, and since my cardiologist appointment about a month agao I've only missed two doses. But my heart is still acting up. I am hoping to get ANOTHER test ordered by my endo for next month to see if my current perscription (when taken correctly) is enough, before letting her up the dose again.As far as the pregnancy thing goes, I've talked extensively with my endo about safety for the fetus, and chose PTU as a treatment instead of going with RAI or surgery since going hypo CAN be potentially worse on a fetus. I feel confident in my choice, tho I plan to do RAI in the future. However, I haven't really asked about MY safety during pregnancy. We are considering never getting pregnant because of the risks to my life, and I think it would help me if I heard some women with the same experience getting through their pregnancies, or not. My mother had preeclampsia with both pregnancies, and EVERY person in my family and extended family has some heart related medical problem. Heart disease kills almost everyone in my family, so I'm scared of the \"heart failure\" risk too. I'm sorry for my long, rambley posts, I'm very scatter brained naturally, and very disheartened about this pregnancy issue.",

            "answer": "I'll start off by saying that I have hashi's instead of graves. I've had hypo symptoms for several years before pregnancy and always had a normal TSH until AFTER I gave birth. Since I never got morning sickness, and didnt show until way way later, I had very little to complain about, so during my pregnancy I would continually joke about how I could die giving birth so that my husband would feel guilty. I never even heard of preeclampsia until they told me that I would be having a cesarean and would not be allowed to leave the hospital until then. I felt perfectly fine and thought everyone was crazy. I was aware though that I had gained 12lbs in one week, but when I asked about it, that's when they sent me to the hospital for more testing. By this time I was going in every week, and apparently started having hypertension the week before, but they didnt tell me. The next time they checked, the nurse had left in a panic to get the doctor. When the doctor came in, she started mentioning something about HELLP syndrome, and a bunch of other medical jargon that I hadn't heard of. The excess weight was mostly water retention, but I assumed this was normal since pregnant women are supposed to have swollen feet, right?Anyway, pretty much you can't die from preeclampsia in the modern first world unless you decide for some reason to go all pioneer, birthing the child at home without any medical assistance. Your pressure is always monitored every time you go in for a check up, and the closer to time, you start going every other week, and eventually every week. Every visit they make you pee into a cup, which was how they confirmed my preeclampsia that eventful day. They basically suspected this the week before from the tests, they just kept it to themselves. You don't want to worry a pregnant lady, especially one with high blood pressure.I say that if you're able to conceive, go for it. Since you already have the diagnosis, they are going to continually monitor your thyroid levels, something they never did for me, and as long as they stay stable, you might not even get it. But you can always purchase your own blood pressure tester yourself and monitor it on your own daily, if worried. Also, you may want to check your weight each day once pregnant. Preeclampsia mostly only occurs during the last trimester, but if you noticed that you gained an insane amount of weight like I did, (5-15 in one week) then you'll have another red flag. The third red flag is if you notice bubbles in your urine. One of the deals with preeclampsia is that you have excess protein in your urine, which ends up causing bubbles. A forth red flag is chest pains. So if any of the four occur, you can tell your doctor and they'll bring you in for an earlier appointment to check.I ended up having a beautiful healthy baby at 37 and a half weeks (so just barely not a premmie) but she was pretty much done and had a full head of hair. If you are unable to conceive though, are worried that your future child might be born with physical or mental challenges, or just don't want to wreck your body even further, then by all means adopt. But if you, personally, truly want your own, then I don't see any reason why you should worry about preeclampsia. If it happens, it happens, but with all the monitoring going on, it shouldn't really become an issue, especially since going in, they know that 1) you have a an autoimmune disease, 2) have a thyroid condition, and 3) have a family history of preeclampsia.They released me from the hospital though still with high blood pressure, but I guess they thought it was safe enough to let me go. (Your own bedroom is going to be more peaceful than a hospital room) I ended up being the only one in the elevator who saw the really cool fireworks, but I just wanted to go home, so I kept this to myself. Later that night (4am) I woke up to a horrible migraine. I had never experienced such a thing before. It was internal, inner right, not on the outside like normal headaches. It grew in intensity until I woke up, and then lessened. I think it might've been a blood clot that I was passing. Im not sure if the hypertension caused that. So, if you're worried, tell the doctor/nurse everything. Don't just keep it to yourself, like I tended to do.However, if it were me, and I was currently having heart issues, I'd wait. Also, since your medication is making your hair fall out, I'd also wait until your body adjusts to it.",

            "answer": "Wow, thank you, UmmYeahOk! That was exactly the kind of first hand experience I was looking for. I never thought about monitoring my blood pressure at home, that would definitely ease my mind. It seems like most pregnancies have SOMETHING go haywire at some point. We are definitely going to wait IF we decide to go for it, I'm hoping to see a remission before conceiving. But I'm a worrier and I'm worry ahead of time.. You know.. Cuz worrying helps everything :)You mentioned not wanting to wreck my body any further. Ya know, that has been sitting there in my mind for years. 1.) I don't know how I'll deal with all the pain I'm always in when I can't take simple pain meds (between pregnancy and an ulcer over the counter pain relief is pretty much zero options). But also 2.) My body has seriously been through a LOT, my hair looks like a mangy dog's from my meds, I've got one bulgey eye and one not bulgey eye, and my whole body has basically been on over drive for 6-8 years. Why on earth am I considering making it go through something as difficult as carrying a child, let alone if its twins (they run in my family). I don't know why I'm still considering it.. I'm just simply compelled to have a baby what can I say?Again thank you so much. I've never even had a pregnant friend or relative to see how the whole thing works.. So the internet and books is all I really know about pregnancy problems.",

            "answer": "Totie, thank you! Your story is amazingly helpful! I can't believe you experienced both the pre-enclampsia and two thyroid storms! That's 2 of my biggest fears and they've been holding me back. Maybe I'm over-reacting about my own actual risk. You got pretty far along in your pregnancy with untreated graves, and both you and your son are happy campers now! Wow. That definitely gives me some perspective of what the doctors meant when they said if its treated, you don't really need to worry. I thought what happened to you would end up happening to me (even if my levels were great when I concieved, I feared everything would go hay-wire because that's my luck). But I guess that's really only what happens to UNTREATED graves? Hmmm. Thank you all so much. I greeted my husband after work yesterday in tears, I was feeling sorry for myself, after my sister announced her 2nd twin pregnancy that morning. And I had convinced myself I'd never survive a pregnancy, and I'd never know that joy. I can't wait to greet him tonight with news of people who have been through this. With not a tear shed. :) thank you. This gives me hope",

            "answer": "Really?!? Goodness, well, I guess the nurse didn't say specifically that it was hyper.. Maybe I just assumed. Wow. I didn't even think of that as a thing. I have tachycardia from the graves.. It was fine and then came back with worse chest pain and numbness in my arms and shoulders about a month ago. (I always have the chest pain and numbness/pain in my arms and shoulders, and chest pain. but this last episode, the pain took mybreath away it was so sharp and sudden, so it was worse than normal) So I went in to see cardiologist. They ordered a thyroid test, an echocardiagram and a stress test, and told me to take my beta blockers instead of forgetting them. All my tests (heart tests) came back fine except my thyroid blood test. Can hypo cause heart symptoms? I definitely wasn't taking my beta blockers, and drinking buckets of coffee, and the heart doctor gave me a \"you know better\" look and now I'm taking my beta blockers more regularly, but not perfectly. I can't believe I'm hypo. My symptoms were the same as my hyper. Is that what happens? I thought my symptoms would be different.The first symptom i noticed coming back was my \"hulk\" episodes as I call them, where I get irritated to the point where I get inraged.Then I noticed I was sleeping WAY more often, sometimes all day.Then I realized my muscles were weakening again, I had been walking 6 miles, easy peasy, and now my basement steps are becoming difficult.Then my heart went crazy.My hair started falling out as soon as I was taken from two 50mg PTU to three 50mg PTU.Maybe 150mg a day is too much. I guess it is if I'm hypo. MAYBE MY HAIR WILL STOP FALLING OUT!!!!!! That would be awesome! :) thank you for the insight. Do my symptoms match hypo symtoms too? I always had weird hyper symptoms, I gained 110lbs from graves instead of losing weight like everyone else. I also slept all day, was terribly weak, but I had zero anxiety. I've developed anxiety now that I'm on ptu. Maybe I'm just weird.",

Here's what I remember of the whole \"getting diagnosed\" events:I had probably 20 E.K.G.s in the span of two years (or is that the brain waves.. Maybe E.E.G. is the heart one?) And I had to wear a heart montior, and nothing caught my tachycardia until the last one. Then I mentioned off hand to my doctor (who had been trying so hard to figure out what my problem was for a year) that my nails kept breaking off below the nailbed. He immediately frowned and went for my throat. He poked and squeezed and said it felt a little enlarged and ordered ANOTHER ekg (eeg?) For my heart and an ultrasound of my \"goiter\" and lab work. The heart thingy found my tachycardia and I guess they had a tip off from either the ultrasound or the labs, I don't know, I didn't ask. I just sat there in shock when he said I needed to see a cardiologist and an endochronologist (I had no idea what an endo was).I went to the endo, she had me go to the hospital for a test. They gave me a readioactive-iodine pill (I was super freaked out by that) and then I layed on a bed in a dark room not allowed to move an inch, while this giant machine sat over my throat and I guess photographed how my thyroid and the iodine reacted together or something? I'm not sure. It took a long time.I might have had another lab done, I'm not sure. When I went back to see the endo she said it was graves disease. (Which sounded like a death sentence because of the word \"grave\") then I went back to her and we discussed treatment options. (At some point I saw my cardiologist too during all that).",

    "question": "Hi, this is my first time finding this site. I have been struggling with Grave's disease symptoms since about 2005. I was finally correctly diagnosed in 2011. I chose to take PTU and a beta blocker, since my endo said it was safe for the baby.But now my husband and I are worried about the risk of pre-enclampsia, heart failure, and thyroid storm brought on from pregnancy complications. My husband says even though its a small risk, he would rather adopt than put me at risk of death, leaving him and an infant without me. I'm worried about that too. I've talked with the doctors and they continue to say that once my levels are controled there's no reason for graves patients to worry. And then they also say my risk of the above is higher. I think my question is, really just an effort to hear some real-life experience of women who have had pregnancies with graves disease, and also, does anyone know anybody who died from prgnancy/labor/postpartum-thyroid storm, heart failure or pre-eclampsia? I know the facts, but I don't know ANYONE with the disease who has any personal stories to share. I am very upset at both options, risking death when I could have avoided it, or never ever experiencing pregnancy and giving birth to our child. I'm fine with adopting (and we definitely will), but I always thought I'd be pregnant oneday too. Any personal experience is helpful and I desperately await it.",
