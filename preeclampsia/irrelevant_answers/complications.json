No one can predict how a birth will go and I am only saying this because it sounded as though you had a little self-blame in your post about pushing him. Prayers sent your way hun :)",

    "question": "So today at 6:34 I had my son. I had many complications through out. With my preeclampsia, blood pressure, his heart rate, the pain, & delievery. While in labor for 1hr&half he was caught on my vaginal canal and when i was pushing i busted the viens in the back of his head ): hes in the nursery, hes also having trouble breathing. Hes on an i.v. and oxygen. They said that he will probably have to come back for therapy for his viens. ive only seen pictures of him, everytime i try and go see him i get really sick and start throwing up. Last night i was gettting sick and passed a huge blood clot and my eyes were rolling to the back of my head getting stuck and i was losing too much blood, so i had to have a blood transfussion of 2 bags. Im really hoping i can go see my little man today, for the first time.",
