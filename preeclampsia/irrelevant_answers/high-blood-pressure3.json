            "answer": "They will probably put you on meds to help control it. The same happened with me, had high bp but my urine test for protein came back fine. I was prescribed labetalol at 13weeks that I take daily to keep my bp down. They still monitor me closely to make sure I dont develop preeclampsia. I'm 32+5 now.",
