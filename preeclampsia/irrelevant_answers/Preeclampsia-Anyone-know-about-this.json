A woman is diagnosed with preeclampsia if she has high blood pressure and protein in her urine after 20 weeks of pregnancy.SO MY OB GYN was WRONG! wow. I had NORMAL blood pressure thru out my labor and yet i was still induced.... I couldve been sent home. sheeshh. I was nervous at my appoitment which made my BP go up.",

            "answer": "depends... what were the protein levels? How high? Did they do blood tests to see if liver function was effected?Also, while there are thresholds for what is considered to be high BP, and doctor may also consider what is normal for you.if i were you, i would request your medical records. Find out how high your protein levels were. Did they do a 24 hour test? Also, get your blood work. Find out if the induction was necessary or convenient for your OB.",

Honestly i think he found it convinient for him, Also i was almost 38 wks....BUT STILL IM very angry that it was never diagnosed, he simply went on to say baby is going to be huge (w/o even doing an ultrasound) ..... And thru out labor if i wanted to i couldve walked out bc of normal BP. ://// I dont have much trust in doctors, hence the reason i want to see a midwife.",

            "answer": "Ok.\u00a0\u00a0The reason I asked is because an epidural and other pain meds can lower BP.\u00a0\u00a0Lying down for extended periods of time and having plenty of fluids can also lower BP so that may have caused your numbers to drop during labor.I disagree with your comment that your OBGYN was wrong.\u00a0\u00a0Your BP was elevated on two occasions past 20 weeks gestation and you also had protein in your urine.\u00a0\u00a0Those symptoms are all that is needed to diagnose PE.\u00a0\u00a0Even if your elevated BP was caused by anxiety at your appointment, the fact that stress was able to elevate your numbers to concerning levels is in itself a problem (there may be other triggers that could result in high BP).\u00a0\u00a0Since PE is potentially life-threatening to mother and baby, being induced is the right thing to do for someone who has been diagnosed with this condition.Another way to look at this is someone who has had several seizures will likely be diagnosed with epilepsy. However, that doesnt mean they will have a seizure at a given time (such as at a dr's visit).\u00a0\u00a0The fact they have had a history of seizures is what secured the diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Its possible you didnt have PE (your symptoms had different causes), however you had several of the classic symptoms during your pregnancy and so the diagnosis was made and you were treated accordingly.",

I could have all 10 symptoms of whatever and I believe the only was to diagnose is to have proof that my liver kidney function was indeed bad or whatnot...Just some things we learn when we dont know our rights and what to push for.This time around i know for sure Ill be standing up for myself and not going to go thru with another unnessesary induction w/o the correct analysis.",

    "question": "Sooo. I had awful swelling, protien in urine with my first.... *Supposedly* i got HBP when i went for my 38 wk checkup.... Afterwards they induced me, and through out Labor, I had NORMAL blood pressure. Im confused If my BLood pressure was normal, then how did i have \"preeclampsia\"..... Doesnt the blood pressure have to be high for it to be Official Preeclampsia???!!!!???!!!!!Anyways, I have to have my next appoitment be with a Ob/gyn doctor not my midwife just to make sure my pregnancy is on track and no protiens.To top this off, I thought it WAS RARE for it to be in a second pregnancy, usually preeclampsia is with a first pregnancy...... I dont even think i had \"preeclampsia\" bc my blood pressure was normal thru out labor.",
