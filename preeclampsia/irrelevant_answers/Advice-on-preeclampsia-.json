            "answer": "How's your blood pressure? If your swelling and your blood pressure is up, it's a possibility. Definitely talk to your Dr. My ankle swelled up pretty good about a week ago and I kept them elevated as much as possible. You don't have to keep them above your heart, just put them up on the couch when your sitting there. Watch your sodium intake too and drink plenty of water to flush out your kidneys. That will help get the fluid off.",

    "question": "I'm worried that I may have preeclampsia. It really would be the icing on the cake so to speak. As I seem to be getting every other problem During this pregnancy. The other week my ankles started to swell which was fine. But now my entire legs / feet look like tree trunks! And I no longer have ankles. Im hoping it's just normal swelling but if I'm honest I do get flashes of lights appear in my eyesight, and i have been a little stressed out recently. I've tried raising my feet above my heart but it doesn't do anything, other than become hard to breath. Help any advice is greatly received. I have my 34 week check up with the midwife on Thursday.",
