    "question": "My baby is 9 months old now. She is rolling over occasionally since she 8 months old. She is not interested in eating that much as previously since 1 month.My pregnancy : My pregnancy was complicated with high BP diagnosed 1 month before due date and preeclampsia one day before delivery. I didn't used any drugs for BP. I had an UTI and cold in 4th month of gestation for which i used Sudafed and Nitrofurantoin. And i used multivitamin pills and Iron pills.Her past medical history : She is full term baby delivered by c-section with birth weight of 7.12lbs. She had a breathing problem after birth which was due to improper absorption of fluid in lungs for which she was kept on nasal canula oxygen for 4 - 5 days in NICU. She had diaper rash couple of times. She had Viral meningitis (Undetectable virus) at 50 days old for which she was in ICU for 3 days. In her 7th month she had cold and otitis media of one ear for which she was given antibiotics. First 5-6 months, she had GERD for which we used Zantac when ever needed.Her development : Every thing was normal until her cold in 7th month. she was rolling over frequently before that infection. We made her sleep in the car seat as per our doctor's advice to prevent throwing up due to cough while she had that cold for about 10 days. After that she never tried to roll over and again she is rolling over occasionally since one month. she is able to sit with support. Everything else seems to be normal for us.What should we do now?",
