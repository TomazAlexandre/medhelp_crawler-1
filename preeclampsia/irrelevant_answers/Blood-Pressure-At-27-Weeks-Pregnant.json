            "answer": "that really seems quite normal to me...I mean a LITTLE on the high side, but the high side of normal. increased fluid volume can increase your blood pressure, so you might try cutting back on fluids the morning before they take your BP next time and see if that affects it at all...you're now in the third trimester though and your BP should begin dropping as the baby grows larger and more space is taken up by baby and less by fluid...so I would say just see what happens at your next appointment, you SHOULD notice a slight decrease.",

            "answer": "I think 120/75 is normal, or right about there...and your blood pressure usually DOES go up during pregnancy, but then it begins to lower again during the third trimester. If you start getting splitting headaches that are accompanied by vision problems (but seem different from migraines, if you get those) or you have sudden, severe swelling in your hands, feet, or face....then I would call the doc to come in and have your BP measured, but otherwise I think you'll see a slight decrease next time and just go from there....you could always try going to the pharmacy and using one of those machines that they have and see if maybe your BP is up when you're at the doctors! Mine usually is.",

            "answer": "I would not be to worried with your Bp being 134/84 normal is around 120/60 somewhere between there. When I am pregnant I see a High risk dr. due to my Bp getting pretty high in my pregnancy's. And he told me that I didnt have to worrie intill my pressure got to be around 160/90. and stay around there. I start all my pregnancy with normal Bp, increasing toward the middle to end of my pregnancy. With my 1st, we had our 38w check up was having prob's a week before that and we did end up inducing that night because it was Higher then a few days ago. Now that I see a high risk dr. with u/s every 4w intill the end of my pregnancy, He will NOT let me go pass 39w in my pregnancy due to the High BP could get worst towards the end...Im sure if your Bp keeps getting higher your OB will keep an eye out...But if you do exp any of what Ashelen had said call your Ob.",

    "question": "I had my checkup today, My blood pressure was at 134/84 and the doctor said that was high. It's been high for quite awhile and the doctor isnt sure why. About 2 weeks ago he tested me for preeclampsia and it came back negative and there hasnt been any protein in my urine. Absolutely everything has been going smoothly for this pregnancy other then my blood pressure, And also the baby is a little bigger, But has been measuring a week bigger since about week 19. I am now 27 weeks pregnant and I'm worrying, And wondering if anyone else has gone through this? My baby moves alot, Shes quite active. I had a restful day last week and I counted her moving 300 times throughout the whole day. Could anyone tell me if my blood pressure actually is high? To me it seems quite normal and anything I could do to help lower it before it becomes a problem, Or what could be happening but don't realize it? Thanks so much!!:)",
