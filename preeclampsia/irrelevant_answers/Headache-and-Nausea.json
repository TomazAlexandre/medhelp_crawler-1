The doctor gave me a prescription for vicodin to try to get rid of the headache but she also wants an MRI done this week to make sure that I didn't have a mini stroke or a blood clot. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that all is well.",

    "question": "I've had this dang headache since Friday I've been taking tylenol for it (helps some) but the nausea is horrid. It was so bad this morning that it woke me up from a dead sleep at 2am. I called the clinic I go in at 2pm. I'm sure it's not preeclampsia...I've been paying attention to my BP since the headaches started. I think while I'm there I'm going to see if I can get them to check my cervix and put my mind at ease with all the mucus discharge.",
