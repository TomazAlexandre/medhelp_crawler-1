            "answer": "Preeclampsia is just not safe for mommy...if your kidneys are leaking protein and your blood pressure is rising significantly, they will take baby out sooner than later. With my first, I didn't start having these symptoms till I was well in my third trimester, with them taking baby at 38 weeks. All you really can do is hope that things don't get worst as baby needs more time to cook. Good luck.",

But anyways, my doctor had said it could be the beginning of getting pre-e (had it with my first) or because i was dehydrated. I started to increase my water intake and went back a few days later and had no protein at all. I go back tomorrow for another Dr. Visit. Im 32 weeks though. I wish you the best and hope you dont get it! Especially this early! <3",

I have another apt in 3 weeks and if the protein is still there I'll be doing a 24 hour urine. I'm 15.3 weeks - at the next apt I'll be 18.4. What happens if this is pre e? Has anyone experienced pre e before? I'm kind of worried.",
