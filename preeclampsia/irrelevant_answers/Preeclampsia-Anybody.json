            "answer": "My sister had the same thing and actually delivered by c-section at 30+1. The best thing (although I know very difficult) is to calm down and not stress, that will make your blood pressure go up even higher. If they can keep your blood pressure down it's more likely you won't have to deliver so early.",

I wish there was more I could do than say not to stress, but there's really nothing that can be done. I'm sure the DR have told you there's no cure for pre-eclampsia except to deliver the baby. Have they given you steriod shots for the lungs or anything?",
