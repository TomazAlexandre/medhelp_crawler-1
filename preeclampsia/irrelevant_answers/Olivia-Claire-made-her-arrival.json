I would share my labor story but there isn't much to tell (can't remember most of it). But everything went well according as planned. Only thing now is waiting on the epidural to wear off even tho I didn't want it. But I got to hold my daughter and my heart is stolen all over again! She is so beautiful and so perfect! I can't wait to bring her home :)",
