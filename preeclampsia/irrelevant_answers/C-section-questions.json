            "answer": "I've had 5 c/s, never delivered vaginally. Truely, I'm scared of a vaginal birth. Lol. It's fear of the unknown that gets to us. After a c/s, you are sore for a few days but it's manageable, they do give you pain meds if you need them, and it doesn't interfere with Breast feeding if you choose to. I don't think having a c/s has really interfered with taking care of a newborn. Although it is nice when hubby helps outs :)",

            "answer": "YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT SWEETHEART! Lol, Relaaax...breath in & breath out. What I did was breathing exercises and took trips to the spa to relax me cuz I was terrified too. But you will be fine! Think positive happy thoughts. Go get pampered, get your nails done, get you a pedicure, honey & relax! Yes, you will have some pain afterwards but that's all. During the procedure it was interesting. The doctors will numb you from the torso on down. All you will feel is pressure of them tugging and pulling down there. It took my doc about 15 to 20 minutes tops to get my little monster out. You & baby will be fine, girlie! (\u2606^\u30fc^\u2606)",

    "question": "So I am 32 weeks pregnant and my little boy is measuring 35 weeks. I was told the risks that could happen if I was to try and deliver vaginally. The doctor told me that there is a high risk of the baby coming out with Shoulder Dystocia and that would cause me to have an emergency c-section. I took my 1 hour sugar test when I was 24 weeks and I passed it with a 134. Now they want me to take the 3 hour test to be on the safe side. I am terrified of a c-section. Can anyone offer any advice about a c-section or has anyone had a similar experience? This is my second baby and I had preeclampsia with my first so I'm at high risk of it. I am really nervous about this delivery.",
