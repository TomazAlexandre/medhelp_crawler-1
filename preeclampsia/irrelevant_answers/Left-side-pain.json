            "answer": "Sound like you may have an ulcer and I hope by now someone has helped you. I don't know if you are still out there or reading these posts but my heart goes out to you as I am a witness. I had to demand this test and that test to be done because I was so sick and no doctor could seem to fix me either. I felt like I was doing all the leg work and paying all those doctors for, well for nothing really. It took me almost 5 years and I don't even know how many doctors and hospital's till I finally found a doctor that apparently took his time and listened to me and then did exploritory endscopy and found that I had an ulcer and a hernia and put me on medication and I was feeling better within a couple weeks but still everything wasn't right and it took another 4 years to diagnose me with Celiac's disease. This disease mimick''s and creates other diseases and sicknesses and is one of the reason it is easily over looked. I hope you are well, God bless",

    "question": "I'm a 26 year old female.\u00a0\u00a0I am 5 ft 7 inches and weigh 146 lbs. I have a history of alcoholism and am a smoker although have extremely cut down on both.In 2004 I was diagnosed via CT with Appendicitis and Gallstones.\u00a0\u00a0The surgeon operated and found no gallstones and no appendicitis.\u00a0\u00a0He removed my appendix but left the Gallbladder.\u00a0\u00a0The Appendix was sent of to a lab and came back showing a very small carcinoid tumor.\u00a0\u00a0I followed up w/ a GI and OBGYN doc and no issue except for an umbilical hernia due to me taking a kick boxing class before being fully healed.\u00a0\u00a0That surgery had to be repeated 3 times as it wouldn't heal.\u00a0\u00a0I think this one falls on the surgeon.\u00a0\u00a0Very young and eventually lost his license for operating while under the influence of alcohol.I became pregnant in 2006 and developed Gestational Diabetes and Preeclampsia and was put on bed rest at 5 months.\u00a0\u00a0I delivered a healthy baby girl vaginally with no complications.On 11-3-09 I developed a sharp pain in my lower left quadrant.\u00a0\u00a0(MY lower left, not yours if you were looking at me)\u00a0\u00a0The pain became more and more severe and I ended up in the ER.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on Morphine and told that I had a C-Diff infection, although this was proven to be untrue.\u00a0\u00a0I had a CT that showed Diverticulitis.\u00a0\u00a0They have me antibiotics to treat what they called an acute diverticulitis attack.\u00a0\u00a0I was going to be sent home and then things went crazy.\u00a0\u00a0My stomach swelled to the size it was when I was 9 months pregnant (belly button poked out and all).\u00a0\u00a0I would not allow anyone to touch me as I was in so much pain.\u00a0\u00a0Morphine did not take away the pain at all.\u00a0\u00a0I had another CT on 11-4-09 that once again showed diverticulitis.\u00a0\u00a0The continued w/ Morphine and antibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally I had a sonogram that showed Gallstones and small ovarian cysts.\u00a0\u00a0The cysts were considered normal.\u00a0\u00a0I stayed in the hospital for 8 days on Morphine.\u00a0\u00a0The last procedure was a colonoscopy.\u00a0\u00a0It showed Diverticuli and some reddened areas, but nothing major.\u00a0\u00a0During my 8 day stay I was prepped for surgery 3 times.\u00a0\u00a0My doctors kept telling me they were worried and I can honestly say that I thought I was going to die.\u00a0\u00a0After the colonoscopy I felt as though they had given up.\u00a0\u00a0I checked myself out of the hospital and was given paid meds to take at home.\u00a0\u00a0 Something else that I had throughout this whole time was hot flashes that were so terrible they would soak my clothing and making my hair soaking wet.The pain never returned as severe as it was during my stay, however it never fully improved.\u00a0\u00a0I to my OBGYN fearing that I had some sort of cancer and was at first told that I had pelvic inflammatory disease but after seeing my own OBGYN he said there was no way I had that.\u00a0\u00a0( I have no STD's at all)\u00a0\u00a0He told me he would do exploratory surgery if the GI doc wouldn't because something was obviously wrong.\u00a0\u00a0During that time I also visited two other hospitals ER's.\u00a0\u00a0They thought that maybe the pain was gallstones but had some sort of \"Gallbladder expert\" (hahaha) come in and rule that out.\u00a0\u00a0One doctor actually looked at me and told me, \"I apologize, but I have no idea what is wrong with you.\"I went to the GI doctor who remembered me from the hospital, although I did not remember him.\u00a0\u00a0He called the surgeon from the room and sent me there the next day.\u00a0\u00a0The surgeon scheduled laparoscopic exploratory surgery.On November 24, 2009 I checked in to have surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I woke up to the surgeon telling me that he removed 3 inches of my transverse colon. (think this is called a Colectomy)\u00a0\u00a0There was a hole in my colon all of that time and he mentioned something about my colon attaching to my abdominal wall I think.\u00a0\u00a0He said it was in such a weird spot, and due to my age and overall health, that might do some kind of study on it.Fast forward to December 30 , 2009.\u00a0\u00a0I had started having a sharp pain in my upper left quadrant.\u00a0\u00a0It was under my rib cage and I compared it to someone taking an ice pick to my abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0The pain was a sharp stabbing pain.\u00a0\u00a0It hurt more after I ate although this is key here *** The pain was there when I first woke up in the morning, not ONLY after I ate****.\u00a0\u00a0Again I was sent for testing.\u00a0\u00a0First an ultrasound of my gallbladder showing it packed full of gallstones over half an inch long.\u00a0\u00a0Then I had a test done (can't remember the name) where they laid me on a table for 90 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0At first they put some kind of fluid that showed up on the pictures.\u00a0\u00a0 They filled up my gallbladder and then put another fluid in my vein to make it release the fluid.\u00a0\u00a0Both went fine.\u00a0\u00a0I did feel a little bit of pressure once the fluid was being released which led them to decide to remove my gallbladder.On January 3, 2009 I had my gallbladder removed via laproscopic surgery.\u00a0\u00a0It is now two weeks to the day of my surgery and I STILL have pain in my upper left abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0It is normally a dull pain when I just sit but when breathing deep it becomes a sharp pain that once again, feels like an ice pic under my rib cage.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is still made worse after I eat.\u00a0\u00a0It lasts for hours at a time.\u00a0\u00a0Not only this but I have pain in my lower left quadrant where the piece of my colon was removed if I have to have a bowel movement and shortly after I have a bowel movement.\u00a0\u00a0When things move through my colon it literally feels like a big mass trying to make it's way down a tiny tube.\u00a0\u00a0I go from being constipated to having diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0My stool looks to be slightly green in color and sometimes is kind of \"fatty\" looking.\u00a0\u00a0(broken into loose pieces, lightly colored, etc).\u00a0\u00a0I have recently stopped taking all pain medication and I feel everything.\u00a0\u00a0The lower left quadrant pain, upped left quadrant pain, and the upper right quadrant pain from the removal of my gallbladder.\u00a0\u00a0I experienced hot flashes and cold chills last night.\u00a0\u00a0This morning I had cold chills so bad that I had three blankets on, a hat, hoodie, and winter jacket on inside my house with the thermostat at 73 degrees.\u00a0\u00a0It took me over 4 hours to warm up.\u00a0\u00a0I have no energy and I keep having anxiety attacks (one that lasted for 1 1/2 hours) where my heart feels like it is beating out of my chest,\u00a0\u00a0it becomes hard to breathe, and I become nauseous. I do have a history of anxiety and I take a very low dose of Klonopin nightly.\u00a0\u00a0Last night I awoke with abdominal pain and a panic attack.\u00a0\u00a0I have not had a true panic attack in probably two years until this all began.I read another post where a woman had the same issue w/ the Diverticulitis and then had it in her upper left quadrant.\u00a0\u00a0I believe she went on to have even more surgery. I wonder about an issue with my pancreas but I would have thought that they would have noticed something with the multitude of testing that has been done.\u00a0\u00a0I have a follow up appointment with my surgeon tomorrow, who I trust by the way.\u00a0\u00a0My condition seems to baffle everyone.. and I mean everyone.\u00a0\u00a0I have lost around 4 lbs since this all began.Please let me know if this sounds familiar to you and share your experience. I'm looking for someone who actually found a way out of this.\u00a0\u00a0I am married, work full time (bread winner) and my daughter is almost 2 years old.\u00a0\u00a0I need to feel good and be healthy for myself and for others around me.\u00a0\u00a0This is my official cry for help.Thank you in advance.",
