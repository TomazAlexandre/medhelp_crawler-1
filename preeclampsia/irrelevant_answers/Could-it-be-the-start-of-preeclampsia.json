My 24 urine tests and blood tests look great but my daily urine samples are getting worse and I'm putting on a lot of weight. It's completely normal to have some tests show definite preclampsia and some tests look like you're fine or getting better. BP ranges for all kinds of reasons. I've been going back and forth since 35 weeks with it (I'm 39+4 now). My old doc refused to induce me, saying it wasn't that bad. My new doc was appalled to hear that and wants to induce me on thursday.",

But take it EASY, try to stay relaxed and rest rest rest..I've never had BP issues before, but had a headache 2 weeks ago, then sudden BP spike the next day - to 180/110. Plus my protein was high so got diagnozed with severe preemclampsia. Stayed in hospital for 2 days, they were not able to control my BP. Plus, baby wasnt growing since high BP reduces blood flow through placenta.Do I ended up having a CSection and delivered my baby girl at 28 weeks. She is 30 weeks today and, thank God, she is making progress..So definitely be careful, BP is no joke. Rest and stay in bed in a dimmed room as much as possible.",

    "question": "I had a routine clinic appointment Monday morning and according to the doctor everything was fine however later that day I started feeling unwell and had a headache/migraine that wouldn't go with paracetamol. My partner called 111 that evening and they saw me within half an hour but when the doctor checked my blood pressure it was 160/91 which he said was high and a urine sample showed protein. He rang the hospital and they wanted to see me straight away and when they checked my notes from the appointment I'd had that morning they couldn't believe the consultant hadn't referred me to them ad had high bp and protein then as well.\u00a0\u00a0I ended up spending most of the night on delivery suite and my blood pressure had gone down to 110/70 by the morning. Does this mean I definitely don't have preeclampsia or does your blood pressure go up and down with it? This is my third child and I've never had blood pressure issues with my other 2?",
