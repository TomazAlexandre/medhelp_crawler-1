            "answer": "It is possible that weight may exacerbate the lower extremity swelling.Congestive heart failure would be diagnosed with an echocardiogram - if normal, it will be unlikely that this is present.I agree with the kidney and liver evaluation - since diseases here can lead to lower extremity swelling.You can also consider doppler ultrasounds of the legs to ensure there isn't clot - as well as examining the legs to ensure there isn't a skin infection present.If the tests remain negative, you can consider compression stockings, in addition to the medication which can improve the edema.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Kevin, M.D.kevinmd_b",

            "answer": "The type of swelling you are describing sounds like pre-tibial myxedema which occurs on the anterior aspect of the lower extremities just overlying the tibia.Although dependent edema (from heart failiure, kidney dz, lymphatic and venous drainage issues) can mimick this, I see that you have no clinical presentation consistent with these anomalies.Pre-tibial myxedema is a symptom of graves disease which is an auto-immune disorder that results in over activity of the thyroid gland.I would advise you to have a thyroid panel at your next doc's visit.Have you had any symptoms of hyper-thyroidism?\u00a0\u00a0Any family history?\u00a0\u00a0Any abnormalities in your menstrual cycle?Although you did state that the edema was pitting, poorly trained clinicials often label edema as pitting without allowing enough time for the depression to clear.\u00a0\u00a0If they press down on you leg and the depression resolves within 5 seconds it is non-pitting.",

    "question": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 35 years old, female, approximately 75 pounds overweight.\u00a0\u00a0Last January my GP noticed some mild pitting edema so I followed up with a cardiologist who performed an echo, and felt that my swelling was from veinous insufficiency.\u00a0\u00a0My GP ran blood tests and found kidney and liver functions to be fine.\u00a0\u00a0I became pregnant about a month after these tests and by week 20 had significant pitting edema with no other symptoms, but ultimately at week 30 ended up hospitalized with mild preeclampsia, ultimately delivering my child just short of 36 weeks gestation.\u00a0\u00a0Since my discharge for the pregnancy nine weeks ago, I battled high blood pressures briefly that resolved without medication, my kidneys are no longer spilling protein and I have had 2 sets of blood tests to check both liver and kidney functions, all normal.\u00a0\u00a0My blood sugar is also normal.\u00a0\u00a0At my check up last week my GP again mentioned the pitting edema, it is not in my ankles or feet at all, only on my lower leg in front of the bone.\u00a0\u00a0My GP prescribed Lasix 20mg 1x daily, and this had no effect.\u00a0\u00a0I have taken up walking 4 miles daily to lose weight. So my ultimate question is; all information I find on leg swelling always mentioned heart failure - I have no shortness of breath or anything else besides the swelling.\u00a0\u00a0I can walk the 4 miles and don't have any fatigue beyond the normal \"mommy\" tiredness at day's end, and that is minimal.\u00a0\u00a0Elevating my legs doesn't seem to make a difference with the swelling, and it is just the same in the morning as in the evening.\u00a0\u00a0If I drive for long it does get worse and ocassionaly show up in my feet, but quickly resolves there. I'm curious if this can just be weight-related?\u00a0\u00a0I was on bedrest for 5 weeks prior to delivery.\u00a0\u00a0I would call the piting edema mild, and is not noticeable unless I apply pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I'd like to know if this were heart failure wouldn't I have other symptoms, and ankle and feet swelling? And what else could this be?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
