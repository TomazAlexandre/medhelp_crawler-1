    "question": "Just a quick update to fill you in before i get in to the most recent problems. I'm pregnant with my second child (a boy). My first pregnancy was perfect up until the last couple of weeks, this one has been nothing but problems. I bled at 9 weeks...thought i miscarried at 13..they couldn't find a heartbeat. I have had major swelling in my legs since 19 weeks along with my legs being various shades of red, blue and purple..which they say is because of the way the baby is laying. Anyway the latest happend a couple of nights ago. I was sitting down totally relaxed and my nose started bleeding out of no where. After i got it stopped i figure i would check my blood pressure. It was sky high..i'm talking 180/90 which is really high for me. Normally i'm around 115/65 or so.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway i waited and after 20 minutes or so it was down closer to normal so i figured that it was just the machine i was using. Anyway that night it went up again and the following morning it was again up in the 160/88 range.\u00a0\u00a0I started freaking out and immediately went to the hospital. Of course by the time i got there it was down to normal again and they looked at me like i was crazy. They did do a urine test and blood tests to rule out pre-eclampsia and according to my doctor all levels were in the mid normal range which to them is great.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing was my white blood cell count was a little elevated. She didn't tell me the numbers but now i'm worried about that. She said it was probaby because i had a bad cold the week before but am now over it so shouldn't the levels be back to normal? Anyway just something else to ponder and worry about.\u00a0\u00a0My biggest worry is whether or not i'm going to have those bp spikes again because it just about scared me to death. I had visions of giving birth to my 25 week old son right there but luckily because of all the tests coming back ok they're not worried. But i am...something is definately going on with my body. Does anyone have any similar experiences that they can shed some light maybe? Also does anyone know if a raised white cell count will effect me having a csection if it doesn't go down by the time i'm scheduled to have one? Any help would be GREATLY appreciated it...it just seems like everything is going wrong this pregnancy and i'm really scared.",
