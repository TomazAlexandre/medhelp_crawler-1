    "question": "For a few days I've been posting about preeclampsia symptoms. Well I was brought into the ER today, my doctor wanted to run some tests on my blood and urine. My \"blood count\" and \"iron count\" were low, so I had a bag of iron put through my IV. I started having contractions when I got here, now they're regularly 6 minutes apart and getting stronger. Anybody experience this?",
