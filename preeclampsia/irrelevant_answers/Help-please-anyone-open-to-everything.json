She said everything thing is normal but im severely anemic and low potassium.\u00a0\u00a0Normal range for anemia is above 11.2. Im at 8.3.Idk what to do. The on call doctor sent me home but the nurse told me she was worried that i could wont get enough iron by the time i deliver because i wouldn't have enough blood. Idk what to do. Do i go somewhere else or talk to my doctor tomorrow or what do i do. The hospital said that i have been low since 28w and it has gotten alot worse n why did my doctor tell me. Please help im scared and feel real bad right now. Im afraid if i go on then it will get worse or that if i deliver now the outcome is going to be bad. I have been anemic before but not this bad.
