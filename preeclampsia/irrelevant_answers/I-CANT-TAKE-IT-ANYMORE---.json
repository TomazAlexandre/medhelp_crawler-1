            "answer": "Maybe he is better with older children than babies!! That is totally no excuse for him to treat you badly but some guys do better when they get just a little bigger!! Also, maybe you are having some post partum depression!! I had it bad I mean bad after my first, and I thought my husband was EVIL!!! Maybe try just talking to him and telling him how u feel! Only u know what will get his attention and make him listen calmly!! Stroke his ego a little if u must!! Then maybe talk to a Dr and tell them how you feel! Maybe there is something they can do to help u!! Good luck and hang in there, this will pass!!!",

You may want to talk to your doctor at your check up or if that is not an option you can call the hospital where you delivered and ask for reference/options for post par. depression. if both of those fall through you can also call/go to a Womans Care Center, I believe they offer these services as well. just don't give up!",

    "question": "I been feeling sooo lonely/depressed lately seens I had my daughter March 12th I was induced because I had preeclampsia at 35 weeks 6 days it was hard I didnt want to have my daughter that early but im happy I got to have her in my arms a lil early . . Im a Ftm and I really have and dont get help from anyone seens we got home my husband is out all day and on top of that his 3 year old son has been staying with us for about 3 weeks now ... Im up at night atleast 3 times with my baby I only get about 4 hrs of sleep daily I cant sleep during the day no matter how tired I feel and I have to take care of my baby and my husbands 3 year old .. He doesnt help me with my daughter at night she could be crying and he wont get up to give her her bottle when he gets home from work same thing ... Most of the time we argue and most of the time because of his 3 year old .. He says some mean things to me sometimes like I cant do things right like he makes me feel like Im a bad mom... & I dont take care well of his 3 year old and I cant have his food ready when he gets home ... Like seriously I just had our baby 2 weeks ago ... And I feel like he doesnt realky care about what I go through or How I feel , he seems to care more about his 3 year old than me and our baby ... Im crying all the time and he doesnt bother to try to talk to me to try to understand how I feel .. This is new to me and im trying my best to keep everything toguether as been a mom and a wife .. Im even starting to hate his 3 year old because I feel like his just pulling me and my husband apart ... My husband pays more attention to him and worrys more about him than my baby ... He doesnt hold our daughter unless I go and put her in his arms ... Idk what to do im soo stressed out I hardly sleep I dont even feel like eating or doing anything ... And dont have anyone to talk to .. I need someone who can understand me :-(",
