            "answer": "I had preeclampsia with my first one. Didn't know I had it until one day blood pressure shot up, 3 days later I had to have csection at 28 weeks.Its good they are monitoring you. My baby wasn't growing inside so I had to deliver. But since you don't have blood pressure, the baby should still be growing normally.With my current pregnancy I've been taking baby aspirin, flex seed oil and a total of 1500mg of calcium every day in addition to prenatal vitamins. I'm now 41 weeks getting ready to deliver and luckily haven't had any signs of preeclamsia.So I'd ask about baby aspirin and other supplemets. They've are supposed to help. Also, I had severe preeclampsia, so even if you get it there are different levels. If its mild, you should still be able to carry the baby to term.",

    "question": "Can anyone give me information on this. The doctors are watching me very closely now even gave me two shots of staroids on my butt to help the baby's lung develop quicker , should I be nervous? I have all the symptoms of preeclampsia BUT the high blood pressure, I thought that would be a good think but I still have blood and pretotien in urine so it's like they're waiting for the high blood pressure to start or something. I don't know & I definitely don't know what to think , they don't even want me working and my baby is due in May",
