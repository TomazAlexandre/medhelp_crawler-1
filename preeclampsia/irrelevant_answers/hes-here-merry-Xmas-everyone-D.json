    "question": "Soooo finally I have my baby boy dec. 24 2014 @ 4:16 pm and were both safe and sound cx thank God!!! They induced me today over mild preeclampsia but then again had to do a csection since he was breech. Anyways it was so intense cuz I didn't know what to expect. He's 6.4 pounds and 18 inches <3 best Christmas gift I will ever have!!! I just hope my recovery will be fast so Ill be able to take good care of him more than I'm trying to do right now! That's all just sharing my story! And yep won't be home till this Saturday.",
