            "answer": "I've heard very bad things about taking castor oil to help u go into labor. It can give U constant diarrhea, it can also make the baby poop in the amnio fluid-which is very very bad for baby. Just keep walking, squats, have some1 massage Ur feet along the sides of shines/around the knobby ankle bone. Talk to Ur dr again at every apt hopefully u dr will induce U. Also lookup online & post on the older age group forums. I've just heard really bad side effects from using castor oil.",
