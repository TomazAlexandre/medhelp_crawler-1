            "answer": "I would find out asap by visiting the doctor for a blood test, if you are pregnant, that soon after a c-section, you could have difficulty later as your uterus may have issues when you start to expand. I've read it can take up to a year before your uterus heals completely, but I have seen people getting pregnant soon after a c-section. I'd just be worried that you haven't healed and further along your uterus reopening...it'd be in your best interest to find out for sure.",

    "question": "Hi,I have a 3 month old daughter who was delivered via C-Section 2/10/09 due to failure to progress, after being induced for Preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0I breastfeed her but struggle to maintain a good milk supply so, my birth control options were limited.\u00a0\u00a0They put me on a pill that is 100% effective as long as your breastfeeding well (80% if not).\u00a0\u00a0I recently returned to work (3-4 12hr shifts a week) and have not been able to breastfeed as much.\u00a0\u00a0I'm concerned that the effectiveness of the pill may have diminished.\u00a0\u00a0My main concern is for my health and the baby's (if I'm pregnant).\u00a0\u00a0I know you are supposed to wait a while after a C-Section before becoming pregnant again, so i am worried.I have yet to take a test, but I have this gut feeling that I am, the same one I had with my last baby. The reason I think so is, because the last \"real\" cycle I had was March 21st, and two weeks later I had some bleeding that maybe lasted a day or two.\u00a0\u00a0So, I am definitely late.\u00a0\u00a0I have been nauseous, and my incision scar feels like it's stretching or pulling apart and it hasn't hurt AT ALL since 2 weeks after her birth.\u00a0\u00a0I've also had cramps for about 2 weeks....all of these (minus the incision part) are very similar to my 1st pregnancy.Anyone with advise?It would be GREATLY appreciated!!",
