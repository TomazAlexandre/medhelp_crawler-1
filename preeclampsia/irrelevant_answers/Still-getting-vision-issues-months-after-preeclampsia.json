    "question": "I wonder if you can help me. I am a 42 year old woman. I had pre-eclampsia during my last pregnancy, with high bp, protein and severe swelling, including my face. I started seeing brief bright blue spots/dots a few times a day during the last couple of weeks of my pregnancy and eventually had an urgent c section.I am now 8 months post partum and still seeing blue and now white spots/dots several times a day. They appear for just a fraction of a second. There seems to be no pattern except that they are maybe worse in artificial light, worse in the evening and worse when I have been moving a lot or am stressed. I also see them in the dark with my eyes closed. Also if I look at something small and dark against a white background it will often leave a sort of silver-blue \u2018impression\u2019 as if it is burned in, that will linger for a few seconds, especially if I then look at something patterned. Looking at a light sourse will also leave me with an impression of it for quite a while afterwards. I also sometimes see brief small shadowy/greyish patches. My eye prescription got worse after this pregnancy too (I am longsighted with astigmatism). But I don\u2019t feel that the actual clarity of my eyesight has deteriorated.I went to see an ophthalmologist a few months back and the structure of my eye, visual field etc are all normal. The ophthalmologist said it was most likely the result of the high bp in my eye and to go back if it didn\u2019t clear up. The eye issues have been causing me intense anxiety and I am now on 20mg of citalopram, which I think has made the eye issues worse. Do you think my problems are to do with the bp in the eye, or the cerebral edema I likely had? I am terrified that things are going to get worse. Is this possible? Do you think the problem might eventually get better or is it likely to be permanent? I don\u2019t know whether I should see a specialist again. I suspect there is nothing that can be done anyway. Thanks for any reassurance.",
