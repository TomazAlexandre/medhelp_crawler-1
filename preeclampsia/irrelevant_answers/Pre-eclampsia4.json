            "answer": "I had Preeclampsia with my first one. Because of this my doctor was monitoring me more closely with my 2nd and put me on blood pressure medication as soon as my blood pressure spiked. I didn't get it with my 2nd one.I've heard that low progesterone can cause early miscarriage. Progesterone is the hormone that (among other things) tells your uterus not to expell anything in it. When your progesterone gets low your period starts... so if your progesterone is too low while you are pregnant and causes a \"miscommunication\" with your uterus you'll miscarry. There are supplements your doctor can prescribe. I believe they work. Others don't believe they do. It's pretty controversial...Sorry- I don't know anything about HELLP syndrome...Hope I helped.",
