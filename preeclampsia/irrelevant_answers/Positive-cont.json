            "answer": "Lol they shouldn't worry you like that. EVERY woman's pulse runs high when pregnant, especially if they're nervous, which they usually are at doctors offices. Plus, your heart is working waaay more producing so much more blood. Also, some women have protein in their urine at one appt, and it goes away at the next. I drank a ton of water after having a trace amount of protein come up and it went away. You can have protein from what you ate that day or being dehydrated. The BIGGEST sign of preeclampsia is high blood pressure and extreme swelling.",
