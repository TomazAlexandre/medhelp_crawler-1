    "question": "Throughout my pregnancy I had many complications. I ended up being sent from my clinic to another doctor as I was deemed high risk. This doctor looked through all my records and was so shocked at how much I had been previously stuffed around. I'd had things like high BP, severe swelling, headaches, spots in my visions constantly and pains below my ribs. They then found protien in my urine. My doctor diagnosed me with preeclampsia after blood was taken. He said he would induce me at 37w5d the following week. (It was a Thursday, I was booked in for Monday). So in I went. They broke my waters, started me on the drip and went from there. Nothing went to plan, I wanted to be able to walk around freely with no pain relief. I ended up taking the epidural as it was suggested due to my high BP. So I was confined to a bed with the drip in one hand, attached to a CTG and BP monitering machine. My other hand was severely swollen, to the point I couldn't bend my fingers. At one point bubs seemed distressed , they came to the conclusion he had wrapped the cord around his neck, they asked that I change position to try and help him fix himself .. so I got on my hands and knees and sure enough he was fine after a couple of mins and went back to normal. That was probably the worst of it. One minute she checked and I was 4cm, next time she checked I was 9cm! I was shocked.. she told the other midwife to call my doctor and she told me to get ready to push as I could still slightly feel each contraction, I couldn't hold my own legs so the midwife let me lean one foot on her hip while my partner lifted the other. I was pushing for roughly 5minutes and he was here. No stitches needed or anything. I'm so happy considering all the complications.. It was expected I may need a cesearean with the complications but I managed! The midwife was impressed at how little I needed to push (bub did come out small though!) He's since grown so much. I'm so proud of him. My partner was amazing! Said he wasn't going to look while bub was coming out but he did and he said he found it beautiful but gross at the same time ;) all I could hear him say was \"Oh wow.. wow, oh my god.\" Haha gotta love them. So Ace Benjamyn Thomas King was born 05:03pm on the 01.12.2014 weighing 2kgs & 710gms only 49cms long. I am so happy. Thanks everyone on here who gave me advice and helped throughout, I wish you all the best!",
