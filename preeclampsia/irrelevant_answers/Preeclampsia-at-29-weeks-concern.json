            "answer": "Protein <150 mg is normal. UA should be < 9 and not sure what you mean by total volume. And I'm guessing the UA was a random UA testing for protein? I would think so by the number. Yes, all of your values are high except the total volume because I'm unsure of what that means, but you can call the lab and get a normal level for those.Pre-eclampsia is diagnosed by two separate blood pressure readings taken 4 hours apart that are high, edema, and excessive amounts of protein in the urine. Seems you meet all of those.I am not a Dr. and not diagnosing you by any means. However am a nursing student, but cannot diagnose but can give you factual information. I hope this helps!!!",

            "answer": "Preeclampsia is a condition which is diagnosed by a combination of symptoms which can include the following: high blood pressure, spilling of protein into urine, headaches, swelling/edema, sudden weight gain.Most women have a \"trace\" amount of protein in their urine but when this arises above a certain level that suggests she may be developing preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0From the research I conducted, it was indicated that if the total content of protein in a 24h urine collect is greater than 300 mg (milligrams) then that is cause for concern.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a medical doctor but I suspect your protein level was measured in mg which means you are a little over the \"safe threshold\".In any case, the fact your BP has jumped suddenly, you have noticed swelling and are spilling protein into your urine sounds like you need to be monitored closely.\u00a0\u00a0What did your doctor say?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have a follow-up appointment?",
