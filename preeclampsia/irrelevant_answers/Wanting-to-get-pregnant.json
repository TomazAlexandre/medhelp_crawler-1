            "answer": "Hello,An ovulation kit might be helpful.\u00a0\u00a0The key will be to determine what range of days you want to test.\u00a0\u00a0I think most kits offer ~7 test sticks to try to determine the days you'll be most fertile.\u00a0\u00a0A cheaper approach is to track your basal body temperature.\u00a0\u00a0This technique requires the use of a special basal body temperature thermometer, which typically has units from 96 to 100 degrees, so that each one-tenth of a degree is easily distinguishable. It is recommended to use a mercury thermometer, obtainable from any pharmacy.The woman takes her temperature by putting the thermometer under her tongue every morning while she is still in bed, and before using the bathroom, or has anything to eat or drink. Although there is an expected amount of variability with daily use of the thermometer, an approximately 0.5\u00baF rise in body temperature can be detected in the luteal phase (after ovulation) of the menstrual cycle compared with the follicular phase. In a normal cycle, the temperature rise begins one or two days after the LH surge and persists for at least 10 days. This may at least allow you to begin to narrow in on when you are ovulating, or shall I say, when best to begin using the ovulation predictor kit so you can best time intercourse.Best regards,Dr. Downing",
