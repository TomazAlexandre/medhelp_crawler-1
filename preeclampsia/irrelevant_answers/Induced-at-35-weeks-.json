            "answer": "My ob has mentioned that they might induce me at 39 weeks so I have been researching like crazy lol. From what I've read if there is a legit medical reason they want to get your lo out at 35 weeks you and your baby should be fine. But unfortunately there are always risks. Make sure to ask your dr if they have done everything they can do with induction being the last alternative. And if they have I really do think you will be fine. Good luck and let us know how it goes:)",

    "question": "So ladies I am 34 weeks right now and my doctor wants to induce me next week because of preeclampsia. I am a little scared. I am a FTM and all of this is so overwhelming. I am also a single mom with very little support so I am very nervous. I am blessed with a very good doctor though. I am 35 and this will be my first and only child. I have heard induction is hard and takes longer. Have any of you ladies been induced this early and is it bad for the baby to be a month premature?",
