            "answer": "After some tests I have been diagnosed with pre eclampsia, I am 21 weeks and 2 days pregnant. I experience the headaches, rapid heart beat, upper abdominal pain, floaters and blurred vision, if it was all you were experiencing I would say you can wait to see your Dr. On Tuesday, but to be honest due to the vomiting I would suggest you follow orders and head to the hospital its always better to be safe, so what if you are there a couple hrs. Pre eclampsia can be something you can deal with at home, but also something more serious and you wont know until you are seen by a Doctor, wishing.you the best of luck and sending prayers your way.",
