            "answer": "There is no known link between preeclampsia and miscarriage.How far along were you when you developed preeclampsia?According to my OB, if you have had preeclampsia, then you are more likely than a person who did not have it to have it again during the second pregnancy. However, you are less likely to have it the 2nd time around than the 1st. It is more common in first time moms. Other factors that increase your chances are age, multiples, and if someone in your family (mom, sister) had it.I had preeclampsia with my first pregnancy. It developed at 34-35 weeks, and I had to have a c-sec at 36 weeks when it developed into HELLP. i did NOT develop it in my second pregnancy. However, my OB did watch me very carefully for all signs. In addition, he gave me steroid shots at 34 weeks just in case I did develop it.",

            "answer": "OK... since you developed it so early on, I think you are little more likely than me to have it again, but luckily you're not guaranteed to have it.As for age, the very young and older moms have a greater chance, so you are right- right now age is in your favor.I would request a high-risk OB. My regular OB is also high-risk, so I didn't have to switch. My OB saw me every 2 weeks instead of every month. He carefully monitored the baby's growth and the placenta. He also checked my blood a couple extra times. Turns out my platelets were dropping towards the end, but it never got a chance to develop. My urine was clean the whole time.I am so sorry you suffered such a tragic loss. Nothing can be done to prevent problems, but they can watch and make sure everything is progressing OK. There also have been some studies that indicate continuing folic acid past 12 weeks may help reduce the chances of preeclampsia. Certainly can't hurt to take them longer.",
