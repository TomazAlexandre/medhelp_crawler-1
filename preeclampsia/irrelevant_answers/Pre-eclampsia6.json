I am currently 33 weeks now, have went into false labor twice now and we are doing everything we can to keep the baby in till at least 37 weeks, at 37 weeks toy are considered full term, that is why they wait till as close to 37 as possible. Your baby might be small, but it is fully developed and able to live outside the womb at that point. They want the baby out to ensure there is no issues due to the pre eclampsia,which could be more dangerous for the baby then 3 weeks early delivery. My first daughter was fine and I am confident this is the right choice for my son now too. Everything should be fine and the baby should be healthy!",
