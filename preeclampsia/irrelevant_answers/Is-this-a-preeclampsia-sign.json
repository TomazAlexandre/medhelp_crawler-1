    "question": "Ladies I've had headaches on and off throughout this pregnancy but the past 2 days i've had this awful headache that had me feeling lightheaded. I've taken Tylenol drank water took naps and its still there. I had high blood pressure towards the end of my last pregnancy but that was 8 years ago I don't remember if the headaches were the beginning if it. I don't have any swelling just dizziness nausea and this awful headache. Im going to call my doctor but I wanted to go to the pharmacy and check my blood pressure first. Can preeclampsia start with just a headache and if I had it with my first pregnancy does it mean im st higher risk with the second.",
