            "answer": "Its a good thing they are catching it early! Im not sure whats going on with you but drs and the medicine field can fix soo many things these days! I wouldnt worry your going to a specialist to get better! I was sent to a specialist a few weeks ago due to my son having a heart arrythmia that they caught. The specialist knew right away what was going on and told me when he was born it would most likely disappear and that this would not cause his heart to stop beating! This was something my obgyn couldnt clearly tell me hence the reason she sent me there! Between the specialist and your dr im sure they will fix you right up!",

    "question": "So I had to do a 24 hour urine test Wednesday because my urine keeps having protein in it and they wanted to make sure I didn't have a case of preeclampsia. Well, I received a call and they said since my blood pressure has been great that they voided out preeclampsia, but now they're referring me to a specialist. They said that my kidneys are releasing too much protein. :/ I'm just praying what ever is going on won't harm my baby. I'm 29wks and 3 days today.",
