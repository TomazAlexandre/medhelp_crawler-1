I can set a cup on my ***. My back, legs, and feet are totally done with this pregnancy. I was induced also with my first with pre eclampcia at 35 weeks. And am PRAYING for a Christmas baby with this little guy. I have a sinus infection and feel like a super wimp now reading all you're going through. So keep up the positive thoughts and hopefully with holiday season it'll go by quickly for you and your bump! You're doing awesome.",
