    "question": "I would have posted earlier but it has been literally crazy. So I was due to have my c-section on the 22nd but ended up getting an emergency c-section on the 18th due to severe preeclampsia. If that wasnt hard enough I didnt get to hold Ryan until the next afternoon around 1pm because he was under an oxygen tent and then I finally get him only to have to let him go under UV lights due to jaundice. Visiting the nursery to nurse him and see him just wasnt enough!! But I did get him on our discharge date and he got to come home which was awesome but on Thursday I had to take him for a check on the jaundice and the doc put him back in for monitoring due to a high heart rate. Turns out he is running in the normal range so the last few days the family and I have just been enjoying him. It has been a roller coaster but it was all well worth it cuz my lil man is HERE!!He is James Ryan, born February 18th at 6:41pm weighing at 8lbs 9oz and is 21inches long!I am posting a few pics to introduce him to the community of women that have been my rock in the craziness of this go round!! Thank you ladies!!",
