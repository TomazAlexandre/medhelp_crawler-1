    "question": "I went to the hospital yesterday for severe headache blurred vision & dizziness (all at rest - gets worse with activity). My bp was up to 120/83 then dropped to 80/60 then went back go my norm 100/60. My last record of high bp was 140/90 a couple weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0The doc wasn't concerned even with the protein in my urine. I was ordered an MRI and panicked so ended up with a ct. Ct was clear. The headache doesn't even go away with narcotics administered through iv at the hospital. I went at 3 pm yesterday got\u00a0\u00a0home at 6 am today. They didn't even do blood work. I have an apt with my ob Thursday, but still having the headaches dizziness and vision disturbances. I would have went to him but hE is out of the country until Monday. My ob wants to keep an eye on my protein because I have never had it before. Do u think he will be concerned because the ct was clear? Does this sound like the onset of preeclampsia?",
