            "answer": "i had crazy headaches and a stuffy nose from about 8-14 weeks. headches daily sometimes it would be a full blown migraine and i would just try to sleep through it. its very normal unfortunately to have both symptoms. the stuffy nose was probably the worst symptom i had bc i was up all night tossing and turning to clear up one side or the other! lol. im not sure about your contacts but that could also be causing the headaches. but dont worry symptoms are just temporary. eventually they will fade. i can now breath clearly and only get headaches about once every 1-2 weeks.",

The only difference now is that I can't take anything for them (Tylenol is useless for me), so they generally go on for 24 hours or more. :/ Luckily not too frequent. I wouldn't be worried-- all of our bodily fluids are increased during pregnancy so it makes sense that sinus pressure would go up too.",

I wonder if it could also be related to me needing to change my contact lenses measurements or also because I'm always having a stuffy nose. Anyone else wanna share?oh btw I'm 17w1d :-p",
