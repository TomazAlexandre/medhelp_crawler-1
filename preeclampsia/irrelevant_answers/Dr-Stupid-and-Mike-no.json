I'll be going to get tested with him cause he asked me to come with him. This is the only website where I find reassurance about my fears. I understand that other websites want to make sure they cover even the rarest cases but they really have fueled my fears. I guess I'll continue to find more distractions for the next few days until then. So Mike, are you in the medical field? I'm curious because you really seem to know a lot about HIV as well. Thank you both for your patience here. If you all believe in prayer please keep me in yours.",

I do agree with Dr. HHH, you would be either dying or already dead if you actually had it now. I'm just going to get tested with my husband cause I realize 6 weeks is still the window period and I do admit I'm afraid but I have to think about my unborn babies.",

    "question": "I'd never thought I'd post here again but my husband is going to get tested for HIV at my request next week. It'll be 3 months. I'm extremely nervous. You can look up my posts from a few weeks back, to get to know more about my situation but long story short, I'm now 33 weeks pregnant, and almost 3 months ago my husband cheated on me (unprotected vag. but OW claimed that she was tested for HIV 2 weeks prior and was negative.) I tested negative for HIV, 2 days before the 6 weeks mark as well as for chlamydia and gonorrhea (3 weeks post exposure), also negative. I'm curious, Mike_no, Dr. Stupid, are you in the medical field? I've browsed through your posts and they're very insightful. I decided to finally ask my husband to get tested because for me it was already nerve racking to get tested at 6 weeks and waiting for those results. I know Dr. HHH's view on this but I realize it's all based on his experience. My OB doesn't recommend any more testing either and he even reminded me that in the labor/delivery units it's standard procedure to do HIV testing. I get urine tests done there every time, I figure that if there was anything wrong at all, he'd have me test further. From reading about ARS symptoms, these are the following I've felt since a week after my husband's one-time affair, recurrent mouth sores but at the time we were having protected sex, so I guess that doesn't count but shortly after having unprotected sex (stupid, I know, you can look up my post on this for explanation), I had some persistent itching on my chin, I read that persistent itch was an ARS, diarrhea on and off, when I had it it was gone in about three days. I've had diarrhea like this about every month since that time, and rescently I had it for 3 days but it's been no more than 3 a day and now I'm over that. I've had no fever or night sweats and neither has my husband, however, he's had diarrhea on and off as well and just about as often as me. One time I noticed a red blotch on the back of his left leg which he had no idea how he got it but it's now gone. Today he told me he feels like he's coming down with a cold since he seemed to have a sore throat and that's it. That freaked me out\u00a0\u00a0but I realize that symptoms are not reliable. I've had a few mild headaches but considering how far along I'm in my pregnancy, I figure it has to do with that and since this is a twin pregnancy I figure that I may be getting preeclampsia but that's another story, all I know is that headaches in pregnant women are common in those cases. I realize that ARS symptoms come all at once and leave at once but I've never felt these symptoms during my first pregnancy. I'm sorry for all the rambling, I'm just anxious and I guess my question is, can I expect another negative test describing all this? Are the odds in my favor?",
