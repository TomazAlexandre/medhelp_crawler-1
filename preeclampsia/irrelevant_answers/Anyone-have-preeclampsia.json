            "answer": "I have had it with both of my pregnancies. It is a serious condition that usually includes your symptoms but high blood pressure, headaches and visual changes as well. They induced me at 38 weeks 4 days with my first son and last Saturday they induced me at 34 weeks with my second son. Luckily you are far enough along that your baby should be okay if delivered early. They will put you on a magnesium drip in the hospital,\u00a0\u00a0which I must say is very miserable. You are not allowed to walk at all, even to use the restroom. The worst part though, was that unfortunately,\u00a0\u00a0each of my sons endes up in the NICU due to other issues and I was not able to see them for a day or two because after you deliver, you still have to be on the magnesium for 12-24 hours post delivery. It is not a fun thing to have, but the safety of the baby is most important. The magnesium is given to keep you from having seizures due to high blood pressure.",

OB called me a perfect patient. Now all of a sudden on Tuesday this stuff pops up. I'm like oh no!!!! I don't wanna stress cause I know it's not good for the baby but at the same time I'm freaking out. I guess we will see what happens. Is there anything I can do to stop the preeclampsia? I bet that sounds dumb. Lol",

    "question": "I'm 36 weeks today with my first. I went to the OB Tuesday (the OB didn't seemed concerned). He told me there is protein in my pee and my feet are swollen (that's a first). He was saying that it could be preeclampsia? Has anyone gone through that? I'm drinking a lot of water, milk and juice. So I don't understand.I'm a little freaked out. I don't want the baby to get hurt.Any help or advice is appreciated! Thanks!!",
