            "answer": "I had the panic attacks, more sever migraines, I was constantly tired but felt like someone was pumping me full of adrenaline. Heart racing, sugar level imbalance, etc. Alot of what you are describing. My doc told me that it was partially to do with my testosterone levels being so high. (I had more testosterone in my body than a normal man) When your ovaries go haywire, everything else does too. My doc put me on metformin, progesterone, birth control, and I was taking a low dose anxiety Med. I actually got pregnant on that combination instead of having a period like they wanted. I am off all medication now because I am pregnant and the only thing bothering me is a tad bit of anxiety and sometimes a racing heart rate. Otherwise I am feeling so much better.",

            "answer": "Posted before I was done:What you may try is having your doc do a full hormones count and getting a prescription from them to go to a pharmacy that specializes in hormone replacement. We have one here that takes all your imbalances and creates a medicine specifically for your needs. After a few months yo\u00a0\u00a0have another check to see if the meds need to be altered in any way.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with PCOS long ago and was told that there was a good chance that I would not be able to have kids. ..I now have 2 beautiful daughters. I did not take any drugs to assist in the pregnancies.About 6 months or so before each pregnancy, I started having severe anxiety issues and many strange mental and physical symptoms. With my first daughter, the symptoms went away after birth. But, with my second, I am having a really hard time. She was born 9 months ago.Over the past 9 months, I had 3 months of post partum preeclampsia and spent the entire time on meds and bed rest, A huge tachycardia event that landed me in the ER (they gave me adenosine, which they are not supposed to give people with asthma...I woke up days later on life support from an anaphylactic reaction to the drug), underwent a heart ablation procedure for the tachycardia, saw a cardiologist, neurologist, internist, ENT, therapist, GYN, etc and had all the tests to rule out heart, brain, lung and mental issues.After all of the hospital stays, procedures, and tests...no firm answers have been given. My symptoms are~strange pressure headaches, rapid heart beat episodes often, visual disturbances, chest, back, neck and shoulder pain, tender left side by ribs, nausea, weakness, fatigue, dizziness, trouble concentrating, can't tolerate heat, bright light, noise, crowds, weight gain, extreme anxiety and panic attacks, feeling like pure adrenaline is running through my veins to the degree that it feels like my whole body is vibrating...so much energy it feels like I will explode if I move an inch, higher blood sugar levels, numb hands and feet, and on and on.I do not consume caffeine and have not for many years. I loosely follow a low carb diet. I do not exercise anymore, because I am too dizzy and weak and my heart goes haywire if I try. I have not been able to work for a year. Basically, I am only able to force myself to tend to my kids needs and can't physically or mentally handle anything else. This is very unlike me. I want to get back to myself ASAP.One of the doctors that I recently saw suggested that I may have a hormonal imbalance of some sort. The GYN wanted to start me on Progesterone and I refused. I found it odd that she would prescribe without yet having my hormone test results back yet. I don't want to get stuck on hormone drugs. Also, from what I have researched, my symptoms seem to point in the direction of an adrenal hormone imbalance. The symptoms fit what I am complaining of to a \"T\".My question is to those of you whom have dealt with this problem...well, a few questions actually...After being treated, are you better? What treatments did you use? What tests need to be done to determine the type of imbalance? Are there natural remedies without side effects and things I can do to make myself better? I am so terrified of new medications and do not want to deal with side effects. My symptoms are crippling enough and I do not want to add to them or trade them out. Also, I do not want to treat the symptoms, I want to fix the problem.Any advice?",
