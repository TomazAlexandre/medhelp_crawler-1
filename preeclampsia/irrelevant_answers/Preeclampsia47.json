            "answer": "I had preeclamplsia both of my pregnancies. With my first it developed at 28wks and I delivered at 35wks and with my 2nd it developed at 15wks and I delivered at 36wks. Unfortunately once it starts you can't stop it but they sometimes can manage the symptoms to buy your baby more baking time like they did with both my babies. If you are further along in your pregnancy they tend to look at how your body is coping and babys development and make a choice as to whether baby wpuld be better off out now or pushing your body a little bit longer. It is very serious tho and you need to do exactly what the dr tells you. Pushing my body to buy my baby's time put my liver and kidneys under great strain and you can become extremely ill. Wishing you all the best!",
