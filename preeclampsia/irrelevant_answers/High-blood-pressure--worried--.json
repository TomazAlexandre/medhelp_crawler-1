At my doctors appointment today they had to run a few test on me to make sure I didn't have preeclampsia because my blood pressure was higher than usual for some reason. Idk the results yet but I'm not scared. I'm pretty close to the end of my pregnancy. Me and my doctor talked already, if it turns out that the test comes out positive then they will induce me and I won't be able to carry her for the 40 weeks as I planned but hey the doctors know what they ate doing so I trust every decision .",

    "question": "This will be long, sorry.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 33 weeks and I had an ultrasound today.\u00a0\u00a0The baby is completely healthy and weighs 4 pounds and 15 ounces. He's head down as well. What I'm worried about is my midwife had my blood pressure taken 3 times.\u00a0\u00a0Twice while sitting up (it was extremely high) and the third time was while I was lying down, that reading was normal. She still seemed worried so she drew my blood and scheduled me for a stress test Monday. She said to take it easy until then.\u00a0\u00a0They ruled out pre eclampsia. So I'm wondering if anyone else has had to deal with this? What was it? Did you make it to full term?",
