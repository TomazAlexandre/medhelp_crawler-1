            "answer": "I had severe preeclampsia with my son who was my first. I am now pregnant with my second. As soon as I found out, they classified me as high risk. I have had many ultrasounds (due to other complications I had with my son) and they have done a lot of blood work along with a 24 hour urine. They did all of this so that they could monitor how I progress as the pregnancy progresses. Basically to have a baseline to compare to. They also have me being followed by a maternal fetal medicine specialist. I wish I could tell you more information on whether or not you or I will develop it again, but it is a wait and see process. I was high risk to develop it because my mother had severe preeclampsia when she was pregnant with me. So for though, this pregnancy has been pretty smooth (I am only 15 weeks). I wish the best for you, but my advice is for you to ask to be followed closely by your doctor and let them know immediately if you are having any symptoms of preeclampsia. Keep us updated and I am sure that all will be well! Congrats on your new little one soon to come!",

            "answer": "Wow thank you for shareing your story aswell. At first my doctor told me i shouldnt get pregnant again. Then he said I should wait around five years. But considuring that I feel like he was at fault for how bad I got because I believe he shouldnt of waited all weekend to et my reaults back to tell me I have severe preeclampsia, then waited three more days for me to have him naturally. Day four finally did a emergency csection. Next morning I couldnt breath. They tried cpaps and ned treatmeants but finially inbated me. Its hard to trust his judement. So here I am with a 13 month old and five weeks prego. Looking for the Best doctor in my area so we'll make it threw this time with less complications.",
