            "answer": "Thanks for replying!I have had symptoms for years, and always believed my preeclamptic pregnancy (and a complication and infection from the surgery) was the cause.It took several years (since early 2002), and several doctors who would have rather read doctor opinions and put me in the depressive category (from 2005-2009), than figure out the cause of my symptoms (If I was 'depressed', it was because the doctors stopped listening - not the cause of my symptoms).\u00a0\u00a0I had finally changed my entire medical group 1/1/2010 (except the rheumatologist I had for a year), and hired new doctors; and received several dx's since...I have many dx's now, but the 'major' ones are Multiple Sclerosis (tried to get tested since 2005 to no avail, and finally diagnosed in 2011 - I finally found a neuro who listened, and he had me dx'd with three of my issues in less than four months), Systemic Lupus Erythema, Peripheral Neuropathy and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.I've read some medical articles that have linked Preeclampsia with MS and Lupus; and I'm trying to learn more about it to see what is true or not.\u00a0\u00a0I need it for research for my disability case that I have been fighting since 2006 (show that I may have had an autoimmune issue already present, before my current illnesses came to light).",
