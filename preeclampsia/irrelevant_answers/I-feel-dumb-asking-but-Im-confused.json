            "answer": "Not necessarily, some woman say they never lose theirs. I would be far more concerned with your prelabor and only being 26 weeks pregnant. Did they put you on bed rest? Such a scary situation, I hope everything works out for you. Please take it easy, stay off your feet as much as possible. If you have lost any of your plug they can regenerate, I lost mine in a large clump and was very noticable. Best of luck mama",

            "answer": "Nope. They pretty much just told me to go home and come back when it gets worse. I'm scared to death because my earliest baby was 32 weeks and that was bad enough... maybe I should go to the hospital again to get another nurse's opinion and see if I've dilated more...I am positive that my inner oss was closed because the doc made sure earlier in my pregnancy because I'm at risk of cervical issues.",

    "question": "I have always been induced early because of preeclampsia and eclampsia so I don't know anything about losing a mucus plug, water breaking all over the place, dilating etc..it's always been in a hospital bed all at once for me...I'm now 26 weeks and I am having cramps, contractions and when they checked my cervix I am 1cm dilated (which I was not dilated at my ultrasounds before this, doc looked at my cervix)...so did I lose my mucus plug? The nurse said that she can fit her finger through to my inner oss. I was sent home because I was less than 4 cm dilated and my test showed neg for labor in the next 2 week's and the rupture of membrane test was also negative but (this may be gross, beware) I have yellow discharge that is thick and I have to wear a pad every day...I'm worried that if I'm dilated that I lost ny mucus plug and I may be getting an infection... is my plug gone since I am dilated?",
