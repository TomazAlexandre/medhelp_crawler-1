The most important thing is to remain calm! The higher your bp is the more stress it puts on your and the babies body. Im sure they will do lab work on you and keep a close eye. If you start to get dizzy or have unbearable headaches youll need to check that blood pressure right away and if it is high head to the hospital. If you dont have sympyoms like that just take it easy and relax. Stress is your enemy now",
