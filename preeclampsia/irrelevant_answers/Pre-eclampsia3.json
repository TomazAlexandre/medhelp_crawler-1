            "answer": "I developed it with my first at 28wks but at 35wks my bp went up to 170/140 and protein rose significantly so I had a csection 2hrs after seeing my dr. This time I developed it at 15wks but they've managed my symotoms pretty well and protein hasn't increased so they scheduled me for a csection right on 36wks (2 days to go!!) because they don't want it to go like last time. So I think it depends on how high your bp is, how much protein your leaking as this is an indication of your liver and kidneys struggling, and whether baby would be better off finishing developing outside or inside as to when they'll do it. Wishing you and bub lots of luck!",

            "answer": "I've had high BP since about 25weeks. It goes up and down and never seemed to stay stable. I also developed spots in my vision, headaches, aches in ribs and bad swelling in my hands and feet. They said I was on the verge of developing preeclampsia. The only thing I was missing was protein in the urine. Today they found a trace of that, which obviously scared the life out of me but they said not to worry unless I start to produce more. I also had an ultrasound that confirmed my placenta is calcified.. I've been booked for inducement next Tuesday. I'm back every second day for CTG's, Blood tests, urine tests and bp checks to make sure I don't need to go in earlier. Next Wednesday I will be 38weeks. That's what happened with me :) I wish you the very best and hope everything goes smoothly for you x",
