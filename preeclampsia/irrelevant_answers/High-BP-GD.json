            "answer": "Regarding high blood pressure, definitely reduce the amount of sodium in your diet (decrease the amount of processed also can help-it is crazy how much sodium gets added to that food) and keep drinking the water.\u00a0\u00a0 If it comes to the point where medication is needed, methyldopa seems to be one of the best medications, as it is a Category B pregnancy medication (versus most other BP med. in Category C).\u00a0\u00a0Methyldopa is one of the oldest forms of BP medication and according to my doctor and my research, it is the only one to have an extensive study done on pregnant women (obviously studies are no longer done on pg women), which followed the babies into childhood. There were no side effects in the children.\u00a0\u00a0I have high blood pressure and am currently taking the methyldopa.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck with everything!",

So far, i have stopped drinking iced tea and juice and increased my water intake. I have also tried to cut down on salt. Are there any foods to avoid? Fruits are okay or not?",
