As long as you get your regular doctor visits you should be just fine. The doctors know what to do to keep you safe. You can google it if you want more info. I wouldn't worry too much though.",

            "answer": "thanks 4 the answers and help my drs did tests on Monday and ask me 2 come back on Thursday 4 results & another bp check. Well on Thurs when I returned I had a terrible headache and off and on I kept seeing little tiny moving spots in my vision, that must be what an acid trip feels like! But the doc told me my results were negative but when I told him about the headache he sent me straight to the hospital 4 more tests and they sent me home saying the tests were negative. This morning my drs office called they are inducing me Monday b/c the numbers had increased dramatically and they also told me sometimes the tests won't even pick it up. So let ur doctors know the symptoms!! They told me if I had another headache w/vision changes or anything strange at all go on in & theyll go ahead & get things underway. And don't worry if you think you're bothering your dr, it is their job after all.",

    "question": "Ok, 1st off I'm 38 weeks pregnant (i love the look on pplz face when i say I'm 9& 1/2 months pregnant) But anyway on Thurs. I went to the hospital @ my mothers wish w/ contractions but I wasn't even close to labor I was 70 % thinned & 2 almost 3 cm dilated BUT my bp was 178/97. On average my bp has been 110/60 and I called while I was still @ the hospital & spoke to another dr in my drs office he just said it was nothing to worry about & basically made me feel stupid. Even when I told him my bp. The next day, Friday I noticed severe swelling in my feet and legs &no matter what it doesn't get better Ive got a terrible headache 3 days in a row & an aura in my vision w/ the headaches. This morning MY dr told me she was worried about preeclampsia & ordered blood work & urine tests & give me fioricet fr the headaches. I'm just cncerned as to what type of jeopeardy this puts my unborn babygirl in? This is my 1st & I thought I had pretty much dodged all bullets & this terrifies me. Will my angel be ok? Will I be ok for her or can this disease do something to me to affect my abilities as a parent? Please tell me your experiences with preeclampsia during pregnancy & give me more of an idea of exactly what it is & how it works & what I can do for it.",
