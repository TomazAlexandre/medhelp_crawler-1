            "answer": "Swelling is a normal part of pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I started getting g very swollen in the last few days and at my apt yesterday I asked my dr, where I was afraid of it being a first sign of preclampsia. My Dr said that along with the swelling you need to have high blood pressure and protein in your urine. They automatically check at your apts for things like that. Are you eating alot of food that has a high sodium content? That can be cause of your swelling also",

    "question": "So I have swelling in my legs, ankles, and feet and my right side is worse. I went to my regular doctor this morning and also had high blood pressure... Should I be concerned? I have an ob appointment this afternoon so I plan on asking especially if my bo is high still. Am I more likely to be put on bed rest or is this a precursor to preeclampsia?",
