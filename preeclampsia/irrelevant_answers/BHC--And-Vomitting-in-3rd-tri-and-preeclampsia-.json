            "answer": "Those are BHC. If you had a real contraction you would definitely know!! Also I've been sick to my stomach too in the past couple days as well and I'll be 30wks on Thursday. It's just normal I think. I think it is one symptom of preeclamsia however there needs to be more than just that one symptom. Make sure you doctor checks your urine when you go in.",

            "answer": "i had preeclampsia, and coincidentally did have that gagging reflex return the last week before they decided to do the c-section. not as bad as you describe- just the gagging in the am when i brushed my teeth. however, i wouldn't worry too much. i figured it was just a coincidence, especially since so many people have posted recently about the return of morning sickness in the third trimester. by that point i had many other symptoms that indicated preeclampsia. just try to take it easy until your doctor's appointment until friday. as long as they check your bp and urine, they will catch indicators of preeclampsia. do you have any other sypmtoms?",

            "answer": "I have nausea and vomiting at 36 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I have never heard that that is connnected to precelmpsia.\u00a0\u00a0I would be more concerned with swelling, high bp, etc.And those are bhc contractions, labour contractions grow rapidly stronger and I found they radiated up unlike bhc which seem to radiate down.\u00a0\u00a0If you are getting a lot of bhc, drink some water as that relieves them.",

            "answer": "you do get nausea with preeclampsia, but the protein in urine and hbp/swelling are what they really look for more. you may be nauseaus if the baby is pressing on an organ awkwardly.and that sounds like bh contractions to me too. i have had one set of real contractions when i was at the doctors office on a monitor, they hurt a whole lot more. my real ones started in my back pulsating and worked their way down to almost my hips then wrapped around my belly. it felt like someone was trying to juice me.bh are uncomfortable, but if you stop and think about them they don't really hurt. and you can change positions to ease bh usually. real ones just get worse.",

    "question": "I will be 30 weeks as of Friday and the last few days, my stomach will tighten up on the top part of my stomach, sometimes it will last a minute or so and sometimes a little less. Sometimes they are a little uncomfortable and sometimes I can't even tell unless I touch that part of my stomach, is that a BHC? Or is that an actual contraction?I was really sick for the first half of my pregnancy and had to be put on Zofran, I finally got off it at 24 weeks (although I have still been nauseau off and on, but not as bad) but now the last few days I have been getting really nauseated again.\u00a0\u00a0I gag when I brush my teeth and it's getting to the point I can't open my fridge or go in my kitchen without gagging, how it was at the beginning. Do you think that's something I have to worry about or am I just one of the lucky (eye rolling)women who get to be sick there whole pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0 Could that be a sign of preeclampsia?I have a doctor appt on Friday so I will bring it up to her then, but just wondering what you girls thought.",
