            "answer": "hey there,i couldnt really say i've been through the same thing, because i'm on my first pregnancy, but i think maybe you should just relaxx even if this all happening, make sure that you have people around you telling you it's going to be fine, and mostly if your doctor and the ultrasounds are perfect, i wouldn't worry so much, it could be that you are just over doing it during the day, and you need to take more breaks then before. maybe you should explain to your boss what is happening and he will give you an extra break or two of 5 minutes during the day, and maybe this could help with the swelling. I really hope things turn out better for you, and i also hope that you get very good news this friday at your apt, even though it could be frustrating to hear everything is good, when you feel this way.take care :)",

            "answer": "Hey, I had severe swelling during my pregnancy........ I went from 125lb to a 178lb person within 8 months. Thats HUGE! I also started swelling very early im talking by 5 months i couldnt wear my wedding ring....... and it used to be a little loose. My feet were severely swollen. They checked my urine and ever since i can remember ( while pregn) i had protien in it. ALtho i have not had issues with my BP, I do know that some random times it did get high.... And at one point i was so exhausted and and the last appoitments i DID have High BP, and that was the last straw for my doctor. He sent me to Labor and Delivery right away. And thruout my entire labor i was so relaxed that my BP returned to normal............ So my point is, when your stressed/rushing to get to the appoitment, you will likely have high BP. take it easy take in deep breaths before the appoitments........ maybe its just swelling nothing more. Altho i DID have protien, It doesnt make it Pre ecclampsia until you dont have the reflexes in your knees AND high BP........ hope i helped!!!!!!\u00a0\u00a0 How r u feeling ?",

            "answer": "I am 29 weeks prego and am having constant bp's around 145/95 or in that range my doctor ordered blood test and a 24 hour urine. All came back fine. That was last week. This week swelling has increased and I am so tired. This is my 6th baby and my twins were born at 33 weeks 3 years ago, due to preeclampsia. Also on Monday they did an ultrasound and noticed an increase in fluid around the baby. The doc said I just had a trace of protien in my urine on Monday. I go back Tomorrow (Thursday), and he said we would see what the bp looked like and go from there. He said maybe bp medicine. I am worried. The docs have already got me on a strict diet hoping to control this and bedrest. I want to go to 37 weeks, but I am fretful that it won't happen. I know that God can turn all of this around. I just don't want to have another NICU baby. I get so stressed thinking about going through that ordeal again.",

    "question": "First thanks to anyone who reads this or replies. It might be a bit long winded but i just have to get it all out. My friends/hubby and family are probaby sick of listening to my millions of complaints and worries.\u00a0\u00a0 This is my second (and definately LAST pregnancy). I was really hoping to enjoy this one but alas it's not going to happen. I'm 27 weeks and have been having problems since the beginning. Bleeding at 9 weeks. We had a scare at\u00a0\u00a0Swelling started at 19 weeks (which in my opinion is way too early for swelling to start). Now all of my swelling is in my legs and mainly frmo my knees up to my hips. The baby is also causing circulation issues which is causing my legs to turn blue/red and purple. NOT FUN! They feel like they're asleep and cold most of the time. Swelling is worse in the afternoon after work and almost non existant by morning. It is so uncomfortable though once it starts. I can barely bend my knees. I can't understand how my legs can be so swollen and yet have barely any swelling in my ankles and feet. Anyway this is my biggest worry, bases on the fact that early and alot of swelling could very well mean pre-eclampsia. Since 24 weeks my blood pressure has increased (not all the time but i do get higher readings). I ended up at the hospital one night with a nosebleed and really high pressure. Of course by the time i got there the pressure was normal and the bleeding has stopped. I've had on and off nose bleeds since and random spikes of higher blood pressure. My normal pressure is on average 115/65.\u00a0\u00a0The night i had a nose bleed my pressure was 160/88. Since then the highest i've had is 140/77 but this is still high for me.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor isn't worried..i've had no protein in my urine...she also did a blood test which showed blood platelets and liver function is well within the normal range. I'm just terrified this is all leading to pre-ecplampsia..HELLP or worse.\u00a0\u00a0The latest symptoms is i have gained 4 lbs within a week which i also know is a sign of the disease. I have a doctors appt on Friday but i'm just getting so frustrated. I really would like some advice or to talk to someone who has had similiar problems. I've had four ultrasounds and so far they have all been fine. Baby is measuring a day ahead of what we thought. I just don't feel good this pregnancy and i'm so afraid it's all leading up to something. I've also had a nausea and been extremely tired since about 20 weeks. It really is challenge to get out of bed in the morning and by the time i get home from work i'm almost in tears the swelling is so bad. Anyway really looking forward to some advice or just hearing from those with similar experiences.Thanks in advance.",
