            "answer": "Magnesium is the standard treatment for pre-eclampsia in Europe. Magnesium deficiency is a listed association with Raynaud's Phenomenon and symptoms of magnesium deficiency includes muscle cramps and muscle weakness.Excerpt from \"The Mineral That Could Have Saved 4 Million Women\"..\"Finally, a just-released study of 10,141 women in 33 countries has shown beyond a \"reasonable doubt\" that intravenous magnesium reduces the risks of eclampsia among women with pre-eclampsia. The relative risk of eclampsia was reduced by 58 percent and the mortality rate nearly cut in half among women receiving magnesium compared to those who receive a saline drip. The authors of the study concluded that \"magnesium sulfate is remarkably effective at reducing the risk of eclampsia.\" [The Lancet 359: 1877-90, June 1, 2002]Not The First TimeThis wasn't the first study to conclusively show magnesium sulfate is a remedy for eclampsia. In a 1995, a study heralded as the most important obstetric trial of the 20th century, magnesium sulfate was found to be the most effective approach to controlling convulsions during childbirth. [British Medical Journal 311: 702-03, 1995] By 1998 data from numerous studies had been analyzed and it was known that magnesium was superior to any anticonvulsant drugs. [Cochrane Review 2002]\"Excerpt from Magnesium by McVitamins...\"Symptoms of a deficiency may include gastrointestinal disorders, irregular heart rhythm, lack of coordination, muscle\u00a0\u00a0twitch, tremors, weakness, apprehensiveness, personality changes, disorientation, confusion, depression, and irritability.A deficiency interferes with nerve and muscle impulses. Long-term deficiency can lead to a calcium deficiency, alcoholic hallucinations, unusual face and eye movement, alopecia (baldness), swollen gums, and lesions of the gums. The symptoms of magnesium deficiency are identical with many of the symptoms of thyroid disease, especially hyperthyroidism.A slight deficiency and you will notice slight depression and lack of well-being.When there is more of a deficiency, you can start getting headaches, pain in the lower back, stiff, tight muscles, particularly in the back.\u00a0\u00a0It can then progress to muscle cramps, calcium deposits, muscle twitches and tics and high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0You can\u00a0\u00a0start to get nervous, feel like you're getting old, have trouble sleeping and wake up feeling tired.You body can go into spasms, involuntary and abnormal muscular contractions and jerks.\u00a0\u00a0It can progress to chest pain, called angina pectoris.\u00a0\u00a0 You heart can start racing and can go out of rhythm.There are study's that show that fibromyalgia is associated with magnesium deficiency.All because of a deficiency of magnesium?\u00a0\u00a0The body cannot function unless it has sufficient amounts of this mineral.\"",

I think it would have made the pregnancy and my health during and after much better.Ask the doc to check both magnesium and D3 on you and also do a vitamin panel, to see if you are deficient or low in anything else. For more info on vitamin D3 and why it is important go to www.vitamindcouncil.org lots of free info there.Good luck,elbamom",

I have done quite a bit of research regarding Diet and autoimmunities and what I have found is that Celiec has actually been known to mimic the symptoms of MS. It may be worth talking to your doctor about being tested for celiac or a gluten intolerance. If your doctor is unwilling you can always figure it out yourself by cutting out all wheats, grains and glutens for at least a month and see how you feel.",
