            "answer": "I went through H E L L with my last son and was begging to be induced and they wouldn't. They really won't unless you are at least 38 or 39 weeks because the lungs are still developing up to then. My first was 38 weeks and has respiratory problems. He's gotten better the older he gets and needs the nebulizer less but it was horrible dealing with it when he was born. It's hard to get a tiny baby who doesn't know what's going on to breath treatments from a nebulizer. Just hang in there. You don't have much longer to go. I know it ***** being in the hospital I was for a total of 12 times with my last I think it was. I had heart problems and breathing problems and fainted a few times and close to the end he kept trying to come ahead of time. I don't know what was wrong but I would go into labor and was kept in the hospital a few times. They were gana give me meds to stop the labor but after laying in the hospital it would stop on it's own. I know what it's like to be in the hospital all the time but you're almost there. Just take it easy.I really don't know about pre eclampsia.......is that when you get blood clots????? I think my sister had it with her first but cant remember what it is. I really can't help with that but no doctor will induce that early unless you or the baby are in immediate danger of having severe problems. Baby's lungs are still developing.",

            "answer": "i had preeclampsia at 35 weeks, but by the time he got the results of the 24 hr urine, blood tests, etc... i was 36 weeks exactly. As soon as he saw my results, he had me go straight to the hospital for a c-section. He said if he tried to induce that early, it was unlikely I would progress and that he would end up having to do a c-section anyways. Honestly, I was so sick by that time, I could barely stay awake on my way to the procedure, so I doubt i could've handled labor. I don't know the exact #'s for the 24 hr urine, but at the time the protein in my urine was +4 and my platlets were getting low. Ultrasounds showed that the placenta was calcifying, and my fluids were getting low.sounds like they're taking care of you. How's the baby doing? Has your placenta started to calicify?\u00a0\u00a0DD was tiny when she was born at 36 weeks and i think it's because she wasn't getting the necessary nutrition. If you are OK and can hang on, try to. My little one had feeding issues due to being born early. While we were able to overcome them, it was a big problem for a couple of months.",

My 3rd 24 hr urine came back today and the protein 24hr was 968.I'll be 37wks tomorrow. I'm trying to figure out what its going to take for them to just deliver me.
