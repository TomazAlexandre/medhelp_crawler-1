Dont you let them ship you out until you feel like a million....SERIOUSLY!!!!\u00a0\u00a0You have alot going on.\u00a0\u00a0I really dont think she would've put you on the medication to treat Lupus if she didnt think you had it.\u00a0\u00a0Slow down and at least make sure you are well for at least 6 months or a year before you even let them consider shipping you anywhere.\u00a0\u00a0You get off in the desert and let that disease get ahold of you and it would be just awful.\u00a0\u00a0Unless, they are gonna send you somewhere good or something and you will have access to another rhuemy real close.\u00a0\u00a0I'd just be really sure, ya know...but one thing is for real sure...You wanna pin em down on that dx cuz when you get out, they aren't really good at giving you them records.\u00a0\u00a0Trust me, take a copy with you and put it in a safe place.\u00a0\u00a0I can't get ahold of a dx I got in the AF, they don't wanna disable me with it.....just watch your own back....K\u00a0\u00a0Take Care...Amy",

            "answer": "Deep in my soul I think you are definitely positive for Lupus, just based on your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The reason the doc has your next appt. so far out is due to the fact that Plaquenil can take up to 5-6 months to show improvement in your health.\u00a0\u00a0I just started Plaquenil on June 24th, and I don't have another appt. until Sept. 24th.\u00a0\u00a0She is wanting to see if it's working at all for me.\u00a0\u00a0and it is!!!\u00a0\u00a0I'm excited.\u00a0\u00a0Have your symptoms abated at all since you've been on Plaquenil???\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's very hard to have a positive diagnosis of Lupus.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that you were diagnosed the first time you saw a Rheumy tells me your results were VERY positive.\u00a0\u00a0Now you need to see if you can stay inthe AF with that!\u00a0\u00a0If so, you're lucky.\u00a0\u00a0You will have medical coverage for the rest of your life, if you get to stay in.\u00a0\u00a0If they want to boot you, it has to be for a disability, and that means you MIGHT get paid your current salary for the rest of your life!\u00a0\u00a0I am not positive how that works.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, start checking on military disability laws and check with your military legal eagles.\u00a0\u00a0One of the things I am finding that the scientists are contributing to the cause of Lupus is viruses or infections.\u00a0\u00a0I had a stomach infection called Halicobactor Pylori in 1999, and started getting the Lupus symptoms right after that.\u00a0\u00a0And they are finding the vast majority of Lupus sufferers had that or Mono at some point in their lives.\u00a0\u00a0I went 9 years without a true diagnoses!\u00a0\u00a0Be thankful things are moving so \"fast\" for you.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0And I highly doubt you'll get to deploy to a desert area.\u00a0\u00a0You'll find that most Lupus sufferers CANNOT be in the sun!\u00a0\u00a0AT ALL!\u00a0\u00a0Even in cold weather.\u00a0\u00a0And no tanning booths either.\u00a0\u00a0Also, light bulbs that are UV must have covers on them or you'll get symptoms!\u00a0\u00a0And in some areas of the world, your electric company will give you a break on electric bills if you have a doctors note stating that higher heat will make you swell or have any medical issues.\u00a0\u00a0Grab the silver lining and give the plaquenil some chance to help you.",

            "answer": "Hey Dallasgyl -Oh yeah, I would Definatley say you have lupus...you have far more than the four criteria that are required, and thats only knowing ONE of your blood tests!!\u00a0\u00a0Zmom was also very correct in saying (though you proabably think this sounds crazy) that you are lucky to have been Dxd so fast.\u00a0\u00a0The average lupus Dx takes 3-6 YEARS!!\u00a0\u00a0And that includes people who are REALLY sick....The plaquenil does take up to 5 months to work (it works great, though), and it is not abnormal for your doc to not need to see you until then, unless you get sick.I would get the doc on the phone ASAP, and I would not be deployed anywhere if you can help it.\u00a0\u00a0GIve your body time on the medication so you will be feeling better...You DO NOT want to go into a flare somewhere where they have no clue about lupus, you know?\u00a0\u00a0Also, you need to stay out of the sun...The UVA/UVB rays in the sun trigger the actual antibodies in our blood that are responsible for attacking our healthy cells.\u00a0\u00a0Stay protected at all times....Keep us posted on how you make out.\u00a0\u00a0I am glad you got such a quick Dx...believe me, you do not want to be sick for years with docs looking at you like youre crazy...Take care and keep us posted!Lauri",

            "answer": "Hey, I'm a lupie vet. You gotta make sure to get copies of your records. You're not deployable until they get your lupus under control. I don't remember the reg, but it says you can't be deployed if you're under the care of a physician, and you are. If you do get clearance, though, you can't go anyplace exotic (or sunny) because you have to stay close to a doc and can't do anything which will cause a flair. They'll probably tell you you'll be med-boarded out, but I wasn't. It's your choice, but in my experience, if you tell the med-board you want to stay, and that you can do the work and all, they'll let you, just under a P4 profile.",
