            "answer": "reeclampsia is a serious condition of pregnancy, and can be particularly dangerous because many of the signs are silent while some symptoms resemble \u201cnormal\u201d effects of pregnancy on your body. Many women suffering from preeclampsia don\u2019t feel sick, and may be surprised or become frustrated when they are admitted to the hospital or prescribed bed rest since they still feel well.High blood pressure is an important sign of preeclampsia. The disease is sometimes referred to as a silent killer because most people can\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d their blood pressure going up. As a result, patient awareness of the warning signs is one of the most important tools we have to successfully help women receive the care they need. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with signs and symptoms included here to empower yourself and/or others during pregnancy.What you can do...Proper prenatal care is essential so don\u2019t miss your appointments. Weighing in, checking your blood pressure and testing your urine for protein, each important for detecting preeclampsia, should take place at every prenatal visit. Do not be afraid to question your caregiver if any of these tests are omitted.A good prenatal diet full of vitamins, minerals and the basic food groups are important for any pregnancy, as is reducing consumption of processed foods, refined sugars and caffeine. Eliminating alcohol and any medication not prescribed by a physician is essential. Report all medications prescribed by other doctors to your prenatal care provider so that these products can be checked regarding their safe use during pregnancy. Speak with your health care professional before taking any nutritional supplement \u2013 herbal or otherwise. Although there is no evidence that these healthy behaviors and choices impact preeclampsia, they do optimize your health for the best pregnancy possible.Preeclamsia.org",

    "question": "I am 28 weeks pregnant. My doctor sent me to the hospital 3 times last week. I have been having chronic headaches, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, feeling like I'm going to pass out, borderline high blood pressure and nosebleeds. They keep saying I might end up getting preeclampsia but do far all my tests are coming back fine. I'm tired of feeling so miserable. I don't know if it's just regular pregnancy symptoms or there is actually something going on. I also can't stand up too long or walk too long without feeling like I'm going to pass put. Anyone know what it could be?",
