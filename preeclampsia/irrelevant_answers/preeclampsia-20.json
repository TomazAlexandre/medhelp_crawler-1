            "answer": "My bp was all over the place. I finally called the doc cos my hands were swelling and my legs felt stiff. My bp was 140/104 he put me on bed rest at home. After blood work and urine analysis, he said i have pre-e. He put me on bed rest at home for 2 more weeks til i deliver the baby with 2 weekly check ups to monitor my condition. U shouldn't be up and moving around. Especially if u r getting headaches. If your doc put u on meds than ur pre-e is pretty serious...well not mild. If i were u, i would call the doc office with every symptom til he puts u on bed rest or get a second opinion. U don't wanna do damage to yourself or the baby. Good luck",

I've already received the steroids IM and my headache is super annoying all day long and taking two blood pressure medications, I'm super surprised he hasn't put me on bed rest or taken me out of work??",
