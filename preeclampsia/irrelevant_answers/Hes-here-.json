    "question": "Parker was born on November 14. He was 4 1/2 weeks early. They made the decision to deliver early because I was developing preeclampsia. He weighed 6 lbs 12 oz and was 19 1/4 inches long. He has been in the NICU since then. He was not able to regulate his breathing in his own and his blood sugars were unstable. By the 16th his blood sugars were fine, by the 18th he was off of oxygen. yesterday they switched him to a regular bassinet instead of the incubator. Now we just need to get him to eat on his own and we will be able to take him home. He can make it through 1/2 a bottle before he gets to tired and they have to finish with tube feeding. Big brother was in the operating room with me and then spent the whole day in the NICU watching over little brother and questioned everything they did to him. He's definitely protective! I can't wait to get him home and away from all the word and monitors.",
