            "answer": "If he doesn't offer, you need to ask about a 24 hour urine collection to determine how bad your kidneys are. You also could use blood tests to check liver function, and an ultrasound to check the baby's growth and the condition of the placenta.I have read that it can be normal to have small amounts of protein in your urine. In addition, it is possible to have pregnancy-induced hypertension and swelling without actually having preeclampsia. What has your blood pressure been? And how does it compare to your pre-pregnancy blood pressure? I just recently read that sometimes hypertension or preeclampsia is ruled out because a person's BP falls into a \"normal\" range, but in reality that person's regular BP is normally low, so the increase is not noticed.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest that you purchase a home blood pressure monitor to track your blood pressure. I have an omron that is pretty much idiotproof- we got it at the local pharmacy for like $60 or $70, and it has given me a lot of piece of mind this pregnancy.other things to consider- are you drinking enough water? how much caffeine? are you somewhere hot and humid? what kind of work do you do?good luck and stay healthy. i hope your dr listens to your concerns and gives you some answers.",
