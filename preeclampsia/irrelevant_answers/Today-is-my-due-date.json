            "answer": "Man....I totally thought you had had Matthew already since I hadn't seen you around here for a couple of days.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry :-(I've had 2 inductions....but judging from what you said about Matthew already being engaged and your soft cervix, I'd be surprised if you made it through the weekend, too (not that I'm an expert!)Like any labour experience, each woman will have a different experience with induction - and this can vary from pregnancy to pregnancy in the same woman.\u00a0\u00a0Since your cervix is already changing, you'd likely just be started on pitocin right away to bring on contractions.\u00a0\u00a0With me, my cervix was completely unfavourable both times and so the first time, I had Cervidil inserted as an outpatient procedure and sent home - contractions started overnight and I had Daniel the following day by 10pm.\u00a0\u00a0This last time with Gil, they inserted a Cook's catheter (hurt like H E double hockey sticks!) and left me overnight to let my cervix start opening.Anyway........I had an epidural both times (hard back labour the first time....the second time, the pain was much more bearable because Gil was in a better position, I think - I might have even been able to go it without the epidural, but who knows?)\u00a0\u00a0Labour was longer the second time, though, lasting about 12 hours from the time the catheter was removed and my water broken by my OB....hard contractions started 4 hours later - the first time, I was 8 hours from the time my water was broken and I had Daniel.Basically....ask 100 women who've had an induction what their experience was like, and you'll get 100 different answers ;-)\u00a0\u00a0In my situation, I had no choice but to be induced since my body wasn't doing it on its own, and I had a good experience both times - and now have beautiful, healthy babies!Good luck....either way, he WILL be here soon! :-))",

            "answer": "Hi! Hang in there!:) I was induced with my first daughter. it really isn't that terrible. You get hooked up to an iv and pretty Quickly your contractions start mine took a while to get strong.. i was 8 days before my due date.. anyways If your opting for an epidural you can Get it once you're at a three.. then generally they will break your water for you. Did you know that like one out of five peoples water breaks on their own? The other four they have to have it broken? I didn't until my doctor told me!:) anyways since you'll be paSt your due date i don't think you'll be in labor As Long as me- i was in for 28 hours but i got the epi and slept and watched movies!:) My second daughter was natural my water broke in the middle of the night and it was frantic and she came out only four hours of labor.. But you know the funny thing.. how they were born didn't Matter one bit after they were born and healthy and happy! I don't know how cheesy that sounds but its so true!! ***labor dust, labor dust, labor dust!!!**",

            "answer": "Thanks for the experience's ladies...its helpful to read about how other inductions went.Limonada- My cervix has been changing in like length and softness but it hasnt really changed in terms of dilation for weeks...do u think thats going to affect things? i was hoping that since i seem to be \"so close\" things would at least go quickly by having an induction (i understand it wont be easier, that it will be more painful) but i was hoping that if i had to do it at least it would make for a quicker delivery lolraerae- thanks for the birth stories, that was helpful! and i did know about the water breaking scenario...my doctor told me as well :) but i was still hoping it would happen to me,,,it takes all the guess work out of when labor is really starting and im curious as to what it feels like of course! thanks for all the labor dust...im gonna need truckloads of it!!ammanda-yep its looking like im having a may baby lol hopefully mine is born before yours!! haha id be super jealous!",

            "answer": "It sounds like you will be having little Matthew sooner rather then later. I was induced on my due date and was in labor for 16 hours. I was told being induced is the worse but it wasn't as bad as I expected. The night before they gave me something to help soften my unfavorable cervix then they sent me home. I did not get any sleep maybe a couple of hours. When I went in the next morning I was put on pitocin slept a little and then 12 hours into labor I got the epidural. 4 hours later was ready to push. I was told he would be about 8lbs but after 25 minutes of pushing he was out and he was 9lbs 7oz 21 in. long. So you can do it hun! Come on Matthew give mommy the labor she wants lol.",

            "answer": "LOL Oh my goodness girl! You really are having a terrible time! I promise having your water break is not all it is cracked upped to be (at least it wasn't with my first baby) and it is really gross but it is a definite sign of what is to come =) I didn't have to be induced but I did have to have Pitocin with my first little boy because he was face up instead of face down and i had awful back labor throughout the whole thing and it made pushing almost impossible. Poor guy, the second was much more easy and it also started with my water breaking and it was easy breezy especially after the epideral. Just keep in mind that only 10-15% of women have their water break on their own and believe me I am just an odd ball. I hope Matthew decides to come on his own like today! (LOL) and give you a break =)",

    "question": "The title pretty much says it all....dang it!!! lol today i am officially 40 weeks and officially DONE baby baking! Somebody get this kid outta me! Yesterday, i went to the doctors and everything looked great and the nurse practitioner/midwife that i was seeing was going to sweep my membranes for me if i was dilated enough but i guess im more of like a 1.5 instead of a 2 so she couldnt get her fingers enough in there to do any justice....dang it again!! But she did say that my cervix couldnt get any lower or softer and his head is engaged...she said she would be very surprised if i made it through the weekend! My tailbone/vagina area are sooo sore it feels like ive been riding a friggin horse for 2 weeks straight...getting out of bed is the hardest thing ever and i have full blown morning sickness again...i cant believe today is my due date! Where is my baby? If babies were brought by storks (sounds like a much for preferable route) he would be here today!lol anyway...the doctor said if by some miracle (thats a pretty crappy miracle) i make it through the weekend she will strip my membranes on monday (dilation permitting) and schedule an induction for sometime during the week. Im pretty bummed out about that whole deal...i was down with it when i was having preeclampsia problems but now that my blood pressure is under control and i already made it this far...i was hoping to go on my own. I really wanted one of those traditional birth stories where my water breaks all over in the middle of safeway and me and DF frantically run around trying to get things ready like crazy people and then i go push my baby out ...just like the movies lol. But now i have to think about possibly getting an induction unless i go in the next couple of days (which is hard to see happening...but im also in a negative\u00a0\u00a0mind frame).Can someone who's had an induction tell me about it...does it really hurt more...is it faster? is it possible that i could still go on my own or should i just make amends with the induction? and how in the heck did u sleep the night before your inductions? i think it sounds a lot harder knowing its coming...because u can just sit there all night and worry about it and freak urself out....vs natural just sneaks up on you whether u like it or not lol.Also, the doctor had the nerve to tell me that my baby was gonna be \"a bit bigger\" than 8 pounds...holy crap!! S crew u lady! and she goes....\"you can do it!\" and im thinking ....uhhhh duh...do i have a choice in the matter? because if i do im ordering a 7 pounder! loleveryone pray that my water breaks this weekend and i dont have to get the induction...if i dont reply for a while its most likely because im hanging out in the aisles at safeway trying to make a magical movie birth experience :) lol jk....somebody save me!!!",
