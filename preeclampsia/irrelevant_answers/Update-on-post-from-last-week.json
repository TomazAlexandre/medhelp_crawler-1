And I mean I don't really mind being on bed rest cause I'm in so much pain down there it hurts to move but I just never heard of them starting the weekly appointments so early unless there was a problem but I guess it's better safe than sorry. Can't wait till my little man gets here.",

    "question": "Ok so earlier last week I posted that I was having major pains in my vajayjay that it hurt to make any kind of movement and some pressure down there. Well I went to the Dr on Thursday and was 33weeks exactly. I told him what was going on and they tested my urine and everything and it came back no infections and he checked my cervix and said it was thick and closed and that it was just from being pregnant. The bottom number for my BP was a little higher than they liked but it's not preeclampsia so that's good. But my Dr did put me on unofficial bed rest and started my appointments every week from now on out until waiting till I'm 36 weeks. I mean I'm ok with that but I had never heard of them doing that unless there was something wrong. Any thoughts ladies?",
