            "answer": "I was in labor and delivery again last night to be monitored and my blood pressure was pretty high (140's-150's/high 90's).\u00a0\u00a0Just as they were getting ready to discharge me, though, I had a really big contraction and the baby's heart rate dropped.\u00a0\u00a0So they told me they were going to keep me for another 2 hours to monitor me closely and if it happened again, they were going to induce me right then!\u00a0\u00a0I was like, \"Um ... I'm not ready for a baby TONIGHT!\" :)\u00a0\u00a0I had an hour and a half of steady contractions - lasting between 1 and 1 1/2 minutes and coming every 2 minutes apart.\u00a0\u00a0I was laboring a lot in my back.\u00a0\u00a0But she checked my cervix and I still hadn't dilated so they sent me home.I'm scheduled to be induced on the 19th!! Which is only 9 days away - so crazy!!\u00a0\u00a0I will be 37 weeks and 1 day, which my doctor said is considered technically full term at that point.I still really want to find some ways to ripen my cervix before then so I can hopefully dilate naturally.Oh - and we are having a boy!What about you?\u00a0\u00a0You and I almost have the same due date - yours must be November 10th, am I right?GOOD LUCK with your C-section and soon to be baby!!Lots of love and hugs!",

            "answer": "There is a gel they can put on your cervix to cause it to ripen (I am a little worried that your doctor hasn't suggested it?!?). I had it with my son (who is 19 so the gel has been around a while). They admitted me to the hospital the night before my scheduled induction and applied the gel to my cervix, planning to allow the gel to do its things and then induce me with pitocin in the morning.The gels are made of\u00a0\u00a0prostaglandin.There is also an oral medication misoprostol\u00a0\u00a0that helps the cervix ripen and dilate (if you research this med, please keep in mind that it causes the cervix to dilate so is not to be used in pregnant women EXCEPT to induce labor so there are a lot of warnings out there that pregnant women shouldn't use it...they don't apply when you WANT to induce labor) that helps the cervix ripen and dilateAs I said, a prostaglandin gel was used when I was induced with my son. I actually went into labor during the night (sometimes the gel will trigger labor) and I delivered without the use of pitocin...an 8lb 4 oz baby in 41 minutes from the time my water broke until he was born :) It was an easy delivery and I would 100% insist on the gel or misoprostol if I were ever induced again.Inducing with pitocin when the cervix isn't softening/ripening is NOT a good idea!!!! It makes for really long and painful labor or a emergency c-section :(This is a link to an older article on cervical ripening for labor induction. I hope it helps http://www.aafp.org/afp/990800ap/477.html",

            "answer": "Yes I had the gel too I think it's called cervidal, I was induced the day before my due date and boy it kicked in quick and i gave birth to my son three hours later....but I was 1cm and 60 percent effaced.... Have you tried walking, pineapple, spicy food and sex, the prostaglandins in the sperm act as a natural softening agent...good luck",

            "answer": "Thanks you guys.\u00a0\u00a0Christine - I'm surprised my doctor hasn't mentioned that either.\u00a0\u00a0He's out of town this week, though, and my induction is scheduled for the middle of next week.\u00a0\u00a0So maybe he is planning on talking about it with me then.Debtrap - I haven't tried walking, as they have me on strict bed rest and they won't even allow me to be up at ALL except to go to the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0It skyrockets my blood pressure any time I get up.\u00a0\u00a0I'm allergic to pineapple, so that one is out. :(\u00a0\u00a0I need to try spicy food.\u00a0\u00a0Although I don't need contractions since those are already coming quite regularly.\u00a0\u00a0I just need my dang cervix to soften and dilate! :)\u00a0\u00a0Last night we did try sex and I inserted an evening primrose oil tablet close to my cervix also.\u00a0\u00a0I have a checkup today with another doctor so we'll see if it's worked and if I'm dilated at all.I'll keep you posted! :)",

    "question": "Hello ladies!Here's my story:\u00a0\u00a0I am almost 36 weeks along and have a fairly severe case of preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor is going to induce me at 37 weeks. (As it is safer for both the baby and me to have him out instead of in.)\u00a0\u00a0HOWEVER he is a bit concerned that I have not dilated on my own and that, if we do an induction, since I have not dilated and my cervix is not \"ripe\" that the induction won't work right and I will end up needing a C-section.I have been having regular, intense contractions for three days now.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor said they are the real thing - not Braxton Hicks, but that they're not causing me to ripen or dilate, for some reason.\u00a0\u00a0Also the baby's head is very low.I'm wondering if you know of natural ways to soften the cervix and cause dilation.\u00a0\u00a0I don't need things that bring on contractions, as I am already having those.\u00a0\u00a0I just need to get my cervix soft and ready!\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to be induced if I'm not ready, only to end up needing a C-section.The ways that I have heard so far are sex, nipple stimulation, red raspberry tea and evening primrose oil tablets.\u00a0\u00a0My husband and I have tried all of these.\u00a0\u00a0I just started the raspberry tea and evening primrose oil last night.Do you have any other suggestions?\u00a0\u00a0And know how long they take to normally get the cervix ripe?Thank you so much in advance!!\u00a0\u00a0I know it's not \"normal\" to be wanting/needing to ripen the cervix when you are only 36 weeks along.\u00a0\u00a0But because of my preeclampsia and needing to be induced soon, it is better.Thanks again!",
