My urine came back clean that night.WELL....we got home about 7pm that night and by 9:30 hit, I have vomiting uncontrolably...FOR 15 HOURS!!!\u00a0\u00a0Diaharrea started only a couple times, but obviously that was due from me not having any food.\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't hold anything down, so we went right to L&D.\u00a0\u00a0I was just there 15-16 hours prior, so they knew something was going on.\u00a0\u00a0I gave my first urine sample and it came back showing protien.\u00a0\u00a0GREAT!!!!!!!\u00a0\u00a0I was hooked up to the montior and the baby's heartrate was betwen 178-198, then would disappear with every contraction.\u00a0\u00a0I was freaking out.\u00a0\u00a0I was given 2 IV bags of solution, stayed at the hospital for 7 hours to wait myself and the baby and gave a second urine sample.\u00a0\u00a0I won't hear anything about this sample until later today because it was the sterile cup.I was sent home to just REST, drink TONS of water and to follow the \"BRATT\" Diet....Bananas, rice, applesauce, Toast and Tea.\u00a0\u00a0So if I hear anything else, I'll come on and let you all know.I have to put my son on the bus right now~Be back later-Hope everyone else is doing fine-Brandi",
