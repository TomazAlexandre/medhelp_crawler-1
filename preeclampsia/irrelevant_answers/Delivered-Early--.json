    "question": "So i was due may 22th but ended up having my baby girl on April 10th. I developed a severe case of preeclampsia & had no choice. My sweet baby girl is now in the nicu working on not forgetting to breathe on her own. I wanted to carry her full term of course but since she had to come early for the both of us I'm glad she's at least healthy. Not to mention extremely feisty",
