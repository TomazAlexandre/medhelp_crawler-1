            "answer": "This is a hard topic, on one hand it's obviously really nice if people decide to buy stuff for baby to be. But on the other hand, it should never be expected. I can absolutely see how it would really feel like your missing out by not having a baby shower to celebrate, but it really shouldn't be about the gifts. Babies really need very little early, carseat, place to sleep, diapers and some clothes and baby is good. I had a very small get togrther, literally just my mom, aunt and 2 cousins, but it was definitely nice being able to celebrate. If your finding it hard to afford everything is there any way to see if either grandma/grandpa can help out a bit? Unfortunately there just isn't much you can do about what people do or don't do. Just know the true gift is that baby in 9 weeks!",

            "answer": "I really don't understand why you're upsetting yourself about this. It shouldnt be anyone's responsibility to buy gifts or send money even if they said they would. Times are hard for everybody right now. If you didn't receive anything, it's not the end if the world. Don't rely on others or strangers to get things for your child.",

            "answer": "The etiquette rule that people don't throw their own showers exists for a reason.\u00a0\u00a0 As the other ladies say, nobody is obliged to give someone a gift...even if the solicitation is nicely packaged on gofundme, it's still asking your friends for money.I think you are suffering from feeling isolated, and are taking this shower stuff harder because of that bigger problem?\u00a0\u00a0It's too bad that you aren't pregnant in the same town where you grew up and all your friends are, if that were the case, you could probably hint a buddy into throwing a shower.\u00a0\u00a0If you think you could do that and go back for a visit to attend the shower, that might be a way to solve this.\u00a0\u00a0But even if you can't, I assume you are still glad to have moved for your jobs and financial stability?\u00a0\u00a0It's always a trade-off when you move, this is just one of the things you traded, but overall it sounds like you made a good move.See if you can find a new mommy group or a Lamaze group or something relating to your pregnancy, a new baby class.\u00a0\u00a0It will help you a lot to meet other pregnant women and talk over issues and just make some friends.",

            "answer": "Im in a similar situations, been moving around a lot and dont have many friends near by. Just start slowly buying everything yourself, and if someone contributes later on - great!!!Look for stores that sell used baby items or check craigslist. You can get big items like a crib and carseat/stroller used. Also, sign up for WIC - if you qualify, you'll get coupons for baby food.Good luck!!",

            "answer": "I am of the same thought but if u r feeling isolated have your mom or good friend visit you. This will cheer you up and make u feel better. Confide in a close friend how u r feeling to help get it off your chest. Don't stress. I started to buy diapers already and I am only 11 weeks, picking up one thing at a time is easier then everything at once. Maybe when your baby arrives everyone will show up or send a gift.Take care",

I've never been upset at the situation of it because ultimately it was my choice to move to a different state with my fiance. I am definitely feeling isolated. I just recently visited my mom so she could see me pregnant and it made me miss home that much more. But my fiance is sort of a stickler and crude about (well, life) moving back and I love him so obviously I am not going to leave him to go home to have support from my family. I suppose I just feel like I'm going in blind since this is my first baby and I don't have people around to help answer my questions of help me at all. Which again, my fault. It's like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place because of all this.",

    "question": "I suppose I created this post to vent and ask what do I do? I just recently moved out of state so my fiance and I could find better jobs and be stable. Then we got pregnant. I created a baby event on facebook and invited all my friends to the page, encouraging them to look through my baby registry and send some gifts. It was a long shot. I couldn't throw a party where I live because I don't have any female friends or even friends in general for that matter so I did not have much of an option. About 20 people said they would participate which was exciting! But the months rolled by and....nothing...no one even looked at my registry. So I then decided to create a gofundme instead so they could just contribute what they could and I would do the rest. One person has contributed. I'm at a loss emotionally. I was really excited to recieve gifts for my baby girl and at least have something of a baby shower. Get some sort of help...did I do something wrong? Im 31 weeks and may have been diagnosed with preeclampsia and I just feel utterly...alone. :/",
