    "question": "So my blood pressure is unreasonably high, and has been since yesterday morning. Weirdly enough, I feel fantastic. Theyve done non stress tests on baby, theyre monitoring my bloodpressure every 4 hours, and doing a 24 hour urine sample, which ends at 130. They either think I have hypertensia, brought on by pregnancy, or preeclampsia...i know what both are, but I guess my question is, has anyone else been through this, what solutions did your doctor have, how long were you stuck in the hospital etc.",
