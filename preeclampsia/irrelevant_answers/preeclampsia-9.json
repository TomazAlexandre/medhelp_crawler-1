Apparently seeing stars when getting into a shower(which is where it mostly happens for me) is pretty normal. I have been trying to get a hold of a bp monitor from friends or family just to keep an eye on it anyway but no luck yet. Its amazing how many things there are to worry about when theres a baby baking. Lol. Thanks ladies!",

    "question": "Hello, i am 34 weeks with #3. With #2 i had gestational diabetes but so far no problems with that again. However, lately ive been getting headaches and seeing little stars occasionally. I hear thats a sign of bad blood pressure. Ive been swelling a little but not abnormally. Does anyone know if this might be a sign of preeclampsia? Even without having gestatoonal,diabetes this time? Plan on telling my\u00a0\u00a0doctor at next appt but thats a week away. Should i wait that long?",
