I've had all of the symptoms of preeclampsia and because my high blood pressure and protein don't seem to happen together at the EXACT moment they test me, they won't induce me. My feet turn purple from swelling and they are sending me to be monitored every other day and appointments twice a week. It's crazy how I'm 37 and 3 days but they are keeping me pregnant and absolutely miserable for no reason. I'm so tired and in pain :(",

I weighed more after I had them than before. & I had so much swelling it had no where to go but my lungs. When I got to the bigger hospital they got 25 lbs of fluid off of me & I immediately started getting better.",

    "question": "My baby boy was due today, but my water broke around 5am on 9-24. My husband had ready left forward work, but my sister was with me and took me to the hospital. I had been having symptoms of pre-eclampsia, and sure enough when I got to the hospital there was protein in my urine. They started me on pitocin and some meds to keep me from having seizures due to the pre-eclampsia. I got the epidural and it didn't work!!! Finally after 24 hours of labor I started to push. Little man's shoulder got stuck coming out so I didn't even get to see him until 5 hours later after they weaned him off oxygen. He took to breastfeeding right away though. I had a 4th degree tear. On Friday I was dischared, but a few hours after being home my hubby rushed me to the ER because I couldn't breathe. I ended up being flown by helicopter to another hospital where they had to get fluid off my lungs and treat the eclampsia. Long story short, everything that could have went wrong did, and it was a terrifying experience, but I have a beautiful, 7lbs 11 oz baby boy who I would do it all over for again in a heartbeat. I hope you all have much smoother labors, \u00a0and good luck to toy ladies!",
