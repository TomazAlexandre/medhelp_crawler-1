I would take him in. I suppose if your doctor said it's ok that's ok..... Just wanted to let you know. That pushing, grunting thing is a sign baby is not getting enough oxygen. I wish you the best congrats! Sorry I don't mean to scare you, just let someone know.",

            "answer": "congratulations! your story sounds so much like mine, except that i had all of it happen at 36 weeks, so they delivered right away. the symptoms you describe are identical to what mine were except my protein was +4. i am surprised they induced you. at 36 weeks my dr decided not to induce and go straight to the c-section because he said that being that early, it was likely i wouldn't progress and would need the c-sec anyways. by then i felt so awful i didn't think i'd be able to go through labor anyways. i was falling asleep on my way to the operating room.i'm so glad your ds is doing so well! my dd also grunts a lot, but she always ends up farting or pooping. i can't relate to him pooping once a week, since dd still poops about 8-10 times a day!!! but she is solely on breast milk, so i think that's why. enjoy your little miracle!!!",

    "question": "Well hi ladies!!\u00a0\u00a0Its been awhile since i have been here.\u00a0\u00a0I hope everyone is doing well and having healthy pregnancies!!\u00a0\u00a0Well i had my beautiful baby boy on August 5th due to severe preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0I went in for a follow up routine appointment on Aug 2nd ,as my doc had suspected that i was getting preeclampsia at a previous appointment, and was admitted to the the hospital that day.\u00a0\u00a0I had +3 protein in my urine and my blood pressure was 164/90 and it's normally in the 120's.\u00a0\u00a0Anyways they got in a panic and started asking me had i had headaches, blurred vision or anything and i was like no just really bad swelling which was obvious.\u00a0\u00a0I also had gained 14 lbs in 3 weeks and then another 7 in one week which was out of the norm for me because i was on a slow weight gain since my second trimester.\u00a0\u00a0My doc told me that it's best that they take the baby within the next week and that i would need to get started on the 2 dose steroid shots for my sons lungs.\u00a0\u00a0I was transported by ambulance to OU medical center and treated as high risk where they immediately started me on magnesium for my blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0My husband and i was so scared but we were also content at the fact we were at the best hospital for this situation so we prayed and prepared ourselves for a long road.\u00a0\u00a0i was on complete bed rest because of the magnesium and my blood pressure was not getting any lower.\u00a0\u00a0My baby was doing well but my health was at stake.\u00a0\u00a0I had a throbbing headache that wouldn't go away and thats when the doc started to induce labor.\u00a0\u00a0i was put on pitocin and after a while they put this little balloon thing in my cervix to open it up.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry i dont know what it's called!!lol\u00a0\u00a0Anyway i started to dialate and contractions started after they broke my water at 5 cm.\u00a0\u00a0My doc told me that there was little to no progress and that my labor might had stalled and that we may have to do a c section.\u00a0\u00a0well i really wanted a vaginal but i wanted whats best for my baby.\u00a0\u00a0He wasnt taking the contractions well and at each contraction his heart rate would go down so they pulled the plug and rushed me in for a c section.\u00a0\u00a0All went well there but as my baby came out i could feel the tension in the room.\u00a0\u00a0I didnt get to see him as he was swarmed with neonatal docs.\u00a0\u00a0 I could see the fear in my husbands eyeas as they asked him to leave and i was overcome with emotion.\u00a0\u00a0My baby pulled through!!\u00a0\u00a0Thank God.\u00a0\u00a0He had a rough start but all is well now!\u00a0\u00a0he spent 2 weeks in the Nicu and suprised all the nurses at his progress.\u00a0\u00a0Once he was able to bottle feed it was no holding him back.\u00a0\u00a0He truly is my lil angel.\u00a0\u00a0He came home on the 20th of august and is doing so well.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing is this, i have been bottle and breastfeeding and he seems to be constipated.\u00a0\u00a0His doc says he's not and that he should poop once a week.\u00a0\u00a0But when he was in the nicu i was feeding him the same and he was going everyday.\u00a0\u00a0I mean is that normal.\u00a0\u00a0he grunts a lot..sorry if that sound stupid but are one month olds supposed to grunt alot.\u00a0\u00a0I thought that was a sign of him being constipated or maby something was wrong.\u00a0\u00a0he acts as if he's pushing but nothing comes out! His face turns all red and he whines after that. And once again his doc say thats normal.\u00a0\u00a0i dont know maby it is but has anyone else had this?\u00a0\u00a0here a link to my page to see my baby!!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to u all!! bye\u00a0\u00a0 http://www.i-am-pregnant.com/vip/dallasgyrl",
