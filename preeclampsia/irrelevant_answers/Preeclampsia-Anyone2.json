            "answer": "I had the same problems as you. My urine came back fine, but my blood pressure was still really high. They put me on medicine twice a day and now I go in for nonstress tests twice a week to make sure my baby is still being active and not affected by my blood pressure. Apparently high blood pressure makes the placenta age quicker and can cut off oxygen to baby, so now I go in twice a week until i deliver. I have been since 33 weeks and now I'm 35 weeks.",

I have to be induced at 37 weeks because I'm at risk for seizures. My baby is doing good so far he's not being affected yet. Will be doing stress test twice a week also until I'm induced.",
