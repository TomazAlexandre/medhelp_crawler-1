            "answer": "If you had a bikini cut with your last delivery then they should let you try and give natural birth this time. They call it a VBAC. Only reason I can't is because I have a vertical incision about 6 inches long from an umbilical hernia I got when I was pregnant with my first. I got so big my stomach muscles split. So now I don't have the muscle strength to push a baby out :(",

    "question": "Today I have to go and turn in my 24 hour urine test. I have preeclampsia so my doctor had me do another pee test but she said if it comes back with a lot of protein again she is gonna deliver my baby girl tomorrow. I'm 36+5 weeks today, so tomorrow I'll be only one day short of full term. I'm just nervous cause I have to have a c-section cause I had one with my first baby and also a hernia operation. But it's also been 14 years since that has happened. Any of you ladies nervous about your deliveries or natural births coming up???",
