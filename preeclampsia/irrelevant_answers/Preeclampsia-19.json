            "answer": "I had it with my first and am beig closely monitored with this pregnancy. My forst symptom was headaches and seeing little sparkles in my eyes. I also had really high blood pressure when id go in for my dr appts and protein in my urine when they checked. Another symptom was extreme swelling of my legs and feet, I couldnt even wear mens shoes they were so swollen.\u00a0\u00a0I never had pain in my ribs but I know the headaches and sparkles in your vision and having high blood pressure is a sign. Go to your nearest drugstore and check you blood pressure if its normal its likely just another one of the many pregnancy pains. Good luck.",

            "answer": "The pain in your ribs could be from your baby being nestled up in there. My lil man has bruised my ribs bc that's where's he's most comfy, definitely puts me in a lot of pain. I also get leg pain sleepin at night. My mom suggested bananas bc it could be from not enough pottasium. Also due to the fact there's more weight on your knees than before pregnancy. Sounds like you have the same symptoms as me and my doc has never mentioned preeclampsia, but if you're worried I would ask!",

    "question": "So I posted on another page, because my rib right under my boob was hurting really bad. Two people commented on it saying that that is what happened to them when they had preeclampsia. So obviously now I am freaking out. :( the pain did go away, but now I have a pain in my leg. For those who had preeclampsia, what symptoms did you have? Do these sound like symptoms of it? If it does, do I just call the doctor and say I think I have preeclampsia or what?",
