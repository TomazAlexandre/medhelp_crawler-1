Did he/she tell you there were concerns because of this?",

            "answer": "The only thing she said was that 50% of the time they don't know why this happens and then 30% of the time it's because of gestational diabetes and 20% of the time it can be due to some type of virus. She didn't seem too too worried or tell me to be on bed rest or anything. The only thing she said is my amniotic fluid level isn't considered high (it's still within normal limits) but it's beginning to be borderline. She is pretty much waiting for my results to come back. She said if anything abnormal came back she would call me.",

    "question": "I posted this in the 25-30 year old group but only got one response, hoping to get more feedback. Here's my situation. I'm on my 3rd pregnancy (first two with zero complication add healthy baby girls) and I am 30 weeks pregnant. At my last appointment (28 weeks) I was measuring 32 weeks. Yesterday at my appointment I was measuring 38 weeks. I am not swelling or have no signs of preeclampsia or anything and I passed my one hour glucose test. Doctor ordered the 3 hour test just to rule out gestational diabetes and some more lab work bi have ultrasound scheduled for tomorrow. My question is has anyone had this happen to them? Where they just grew so big and everything turn out ok? Could my dates just be off and baby be coming earlier than expected? Any/all advice appreciated! :)",
