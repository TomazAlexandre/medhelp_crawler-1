    "question": "So I went into early labor on Thursday\u00a0\u00a0the 16th and was sent home from the hospital on two occasions because I wasn't progressing in the time I was there. Finally, my water broke Friday evening and I was dilated to 4cm when I arrived at the hospital at 10:15pm. By the time we finished my admission process and I received my epidural at midnight (2 hours later), I had progressed to 9cm. The baby and I were doing well and I felt no urge to push so they let me get some rest while the baby was \"laboring down.\" I woke up at 7am on the 18th and began pushing from 7:30 until 9:38 when my baby girl was born. Unfortunately she got stuck because I have a heart-shaped pubic bone and they had to use the vacuum extractor the maximum number of times to get her out. So glad I avoided a C-section, but I'm still feeling a lot of pain from that labor. My baby girl was a whopping 8lbs 7oz and 21 inches long \u2661Now for the scary part.. I was released from the hospital on Monday afternoon and didn't even make it a full 24 hours before I started swelling up in my legs, hands, and face. We went to the ER and my doctor admitted me back to L&D with postpartum preeclampsia, which\u00a0\u00a0is supposedly pretty rare since the cure for preeclampsia is usually giving birth (keep in mind I had perfect blood pressure my entire pregnancy too). They put me on this aweful Magnesium Sulfate IV for 12 hours to keep me from having a stroke or seizure. The stuff makes you feel HOT and hurts so bad going intp your arm. My face swelled up to the point that I could feel my pulse in my cheeks, it was bright red, and I could barely see. SCARIEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE! After the drip was over 8 was put on blood pressure medication and monitored over night before I was discharged. Now I am back home with my baby girl and happier than ever!!! Keep and eye on yourself though ladies, even after birth don't ignore your body. All the nurses told me how fortunate I was to come in when I did because they said I would have for sure had at least a stroke if I waited. Don't let anyone tell you you're fine, it's better to be safe than sorry.",
