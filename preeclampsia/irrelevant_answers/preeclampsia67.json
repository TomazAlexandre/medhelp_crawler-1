            "answer": "I was told I had preeclampsia at 28 weeks. I had blurred vision, horrible headache not even pain medicine would take it away, high blood pressure. Didn't feel baby moving and my back hurt alot . I also got swollen from face, hands and feet so doctor had me in bedrest at hospital. I finally couldn't take it anymore I had really bad pain and my blood pressures were just getting worse. So I was induced at 30 weeks. Had my baby weighing 6 pds 4oz. After I gave birth I was fine everything was gone. With my baby at first I was told he was OK and would take him to me to breastfeed but instead the doc told me he had apnea. So he stayed in the NICU for like 2 weeks, he is now 2 and healthy.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry its long.",
