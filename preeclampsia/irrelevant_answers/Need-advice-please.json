With this pregnancy my blood pressures are running where you said yours are at and they say its fine, and its just the high side of normal, although I still have to check every day, andthey are kkeeping a close eye on me, but no bedrest. I was told that if you have a headache that wont go away with tylenol orb your blood pressure is really high you need to go in. If your number is a lot higher than it has been go in. Its better to be safe.",

It usually just means he has to increase my bp meds but he needs to know so that he can monitor baby and check protein levels haven't suddenly increased. I would go in. Good luck!",

And her office is closed until Monday.",

    "question": "I am nearly 32 weeks pregnant and considered high risk. My blood pressure has been up and down for almost the last couple of months and my doc finally put me on bed rest the week of Halloween. I haven't been feeling good the last couple of days (headache that won't go away, nausea, spotty vision) and I went to see my dr yesterday. She told me to stay off my feet and ordered another preeclampsia test for after the holiday weekend. There hasn't been any protein in my urine yet. And my bp was 136/84. Today I woke up feeling worse. And now I have some swelling. My fingers actually ache from it now. So I took my bp and it is 142/96. I don't want to overreact. But I also don't know if this is something I should head to the hospital over. I really need some advice on how to handle this.",
