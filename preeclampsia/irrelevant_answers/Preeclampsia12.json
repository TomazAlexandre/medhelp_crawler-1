            "answer": "It COULD be the beginning of preeclampsia...since you're already 38 weeks it's not horribly alarming to have a systolic pressure in the 130's. I think you said that you have a cuff...keep an eye on it and if it goes up to 145 or 150 go in right away...watch also for visual problems, swelling in your hands and face and upper abdominal pain....just keep up with your doctor...maybe they will want to see you twice per week ;)",

I didn't sleep very well I'm still short of breath and once I got home my bp went back up. Not sure if I want to go back in seeing they tell me the samething but yet they don't follow thru on what they say. All because my bp comes back down.",

    "question": "I swelled up a few weeks ago at 35 weeks. Blood pressure was a little high but it came back down. They did the 24 hour urine test and my protein is in the 500 by which I found is almost double what it should be. Since then I have been nauseous and throw up once in awhile before I even ate. I am now 38 weeks and 4 days just had my prenatal visit yesterday, my dr has not checked my cervix yet my blood pressure was 140/84 but rechecked before I left and it was down to 127/76. Now today I actually threw up after breakfast have a slight headache and feel kind of funny but don't want to run to dr for no reason. This is baby number 2.",
