            "answer": "I think you should google it because it's complex and I don't think it is easily explained in a post. I had my boy at 36 weeks because of it.When your blood pressure spikes, it puts you at risk for a stroke. It also means baby has hard time gaining weight because blood pressure messes up how food is passed to baby. The swelling and edema also put pressure on your heart. It is very serious and you need to make sure that you are eating very healthy and exercising very lightly if your Dr says you may.Ask your Dr what you need to look for to be seen. Seeing spots or flashing lights is one major one.",

            "answer": "I looked up some of it on Google but only thing I got from it was blood pressure goes out of wack ASN that it can be serious and some signs to look for. He's seeing me more often now but what confused me is how it said it all. My blood pressure has Been up but he's not upping my blood pressure meds. He said I so far have no complications my sons growing good and that he sees me end up having the baby due to preeclampsia and I guess trying to hold off for at least 5/6 more weeks I was just confused about it all. I'm guessing that means he's planning on taking him sooner then 39 weeks if I don't into labor before then? He said I have risk factor of the preeclampsia but then he said all that so I'm a little confused. I go on the 22nd to see him again meaning he wants to see me more now",
