            "answer": "Here are my thoughts. I had a vaginal delivery and Twin B has CP.\u00a0\u00a0I have made many friends with other moms of twins, and is is unbelievable the difference I have seen in the ones that were delivered vaginally and the ones delivered by C-Section. Sounds kinda stupid, but I swear its true. The moms I know that had vaginal deliveries, the second baby has problems that will effect them long term. C-Section moms have had no problems with their twins. I wish someone had told me that before I delivered.",

            "answer": "I agree that vaginal deliveries are 100% better than recovering from a C-Section. But, u never know what can go wrong with the second twin, and I'm not sure now if its worth the risk just to deliver vaginally. With a C-Section, both ur babies are out within minutes leaving hardly any room for things to go wrong with the second twin. Take it from someone who has been there.",

    "question": "Hi All,Tomorrow I will be 36 weeks with twins and have been in the hospital on bed rest for two weeks now due to preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0The babies will be born sometime between tomorrow and next Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0I have been transferred to a larger hospital in the city which can better accommodate any issues with my high risk condition as well as any issues with the twins.\u00a0\u00a0As I have been meeting new high risk doctors, I have heard many different points of views on delivery and whether or not to have a c-section or vaginal delivery.I had a vaginal delivery with my first daughter and found the experience to be well worth it, but the doctors are warning me of a higher risk of vaginal delivery with twins as the second baby tends to have more problems once the first baby is delivered.\u00a0\u00a0The possible risks of a vaginal delivery are: drop in baby b's heart rate which would require an emergency c-section, possible water breakage before baby b is delivered (basically making the baby not able to breathe), etc.They have left the decision up to me, but have informed me of this risk.If any of you have been in this situation or have any thoughts on it, I would love to hear them.\u00a0\u00a0Although I would much prefer a vaginal delivery for the convenience factor of having a faster, easier recovery, I feel I need to act responsibly for the risk on the second baby.Thank you!",
