            "answer": "The most serious and most easily prevented complication of pregnancy is known as metabolic toxemia or pre-eclampsia. The symptoms of pre-eclampsia appear after the 30th week of gestation: edema, hypertension (high blood pressure), and protein in the urine. Modern medical science does not know the cause of pre-eclampsia. Midwives however see a strong enough connection between deficiencies in the mother\u2019s diet and the occurrence of pre-eclmapsia to say the pre-eclampsia (and eclampsia, toxemia with maternal convulsions) is the result of malnutrition during pregnancy.Below are listed herbal and nutritional information to help prevent pre-eclampsia. If you are diagnosed or showing signs & symptoms of pre-eclampsia, work with your midwife to help find remedies that suit your lifestyle and are deemed safe for you and your baby.Preventing Pre-eclampsia\u2022 Eat 80-100 grams of protein daily. Protein is needed to form the growing fetus, uterus and placenta.\u2022 Eat salt to taste. Limiting salt during pregnancy does little to prevent swollen ankles and fingers. Lack of adequate salt can cause pre-eclamplsia.\u2022 Eat foods high in calcium. A study of worldwide eclampsia rates found them to be highest in countries with the lowest calcium intake. One thousand grams of calcium daily during pregnancy is a minimum recommendation.\u2022 Take adequate calories. The minimum calorie requirement during pregnancy is 2400 calories a day. This does not mean eating high calorie foods/drinks such as soda, fast foods, pastry, cookies, cake, ice cream, etc. The calories you eat need to count!!!\u2022 Tone and nourish with Raspberry, Nettle, and Dandelion leaf teas throughout pregnancy.Remedies to treat signs/symptoms of Pre-eclampsiaIncrease the level of potassium in your body. Potassium supplements are a standard part of the allopathic treatment for pre-eclampsia, as they relieve and stabilize some major symptoms of pre-eclampsia: high blood pressure and edema. Potassium is favored by midwives because it supports and vitalizes proper functioning of all the organs and systems stressed by pre-eclampsia: liver, kidneys, and nervous system. Potato peels and bananas are exceptionally rich in potassium; Mint, Chicory, and Dandelion leaves also have extremely high levels of potassium. Other sources are chamomile, comfrey, coltsfoot, watercress, nettles, alfalfa, yarrow, borage, eyebright, plantain, parsley, kelp, dulse. Potassium is depleted by: excessive urination or perspiration, vomiting, diarrhea, enemas, coffee, sugar, salt, salt, alcohol.\u2022 Help balance the sodium/potassium ratio of your blood with raw beet juice, up to four ounces daily. This is also one of the fastest and most effective ways to increase available calcium in the body. If you don\u2019t have access to a juicer, grate one raw beet and one raw apple together for a satisfying and crunchy snack.\u2022 Restore the normal balance of sodium and potassium in your body fluids, and promote better functioning of your liver and nervous system by taking 100 mg of vitamin B6 daily in conjunction with a high potency B complex supplement.\u2022 Augment protein and mineral levels in your body by adding up to three tablespoons of powdered Spirulina or Chorella seaweed to your daily diet.\u2022 Dandelion Leaves As strange as this sounds, dandelions are easily found in lawns and vacant lots, there are few foods or herbs better for treating pre-eclampsia and strengthening the liver than Taraxacum. In addition to vitalizing and healing the liver, Dandelion leaves help the kidneys function better, and are a good source of calcium and potassium. This combination of qualities makes Dandelion leaves a vitally important herb in the prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia.If you are able to find an abundance of Dandelion leaves, be creative and look for ways to eat them raw or cooked.Handout created from Wise Woman Herbal for the Childbearing Year by Susan Weed",

            "answer": "I don't think you can really avoid it. I had it with my first pregnancy. They aren't 100% sure what causes it and different doctors believe different things but mine told me it is possibly your body starts rejecting the placenta (since it's made from the chromosome from the male) and makes your body do weird stuff such as the HBP and spilling proteins into your urine.",
