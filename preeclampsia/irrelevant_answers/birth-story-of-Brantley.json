I had 7 in a half hr they then put me on monitors and checked me I was at a 3 Hr later checked I was at 3+ and 80% effaced. Got me to the L&D suite checked again half hr later n was at 5-6 another hr was at a 7 still no epidural and I'm like freaking out cuz of the back labor ready to rip faces off.
