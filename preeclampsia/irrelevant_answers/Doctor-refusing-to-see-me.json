I'm not sure that means much in the situation but whatever. &isn't more a liability for them to refuse to see me if something bad happened? I didn't technically refuse anything just said I wasn't going to make a special trip when I have an appointment coming up.",

    "question": "Hello ladies, I have a question about receiving care. I've been seeing 3 doctors since I found out I was pregnant and by the time of my next appointment I'll be 30 weeks. I've Had High protein in my urine the last 15 weeks or so and even tho its a common symptom of preeclampsia I have not had high blood pressure or any other symptom. I received a call from someone I\u00a0\u00a0lab results a few days ago and she said \"the protein in your urine is still high can you come in a week early so we can monitor your blood pressure:, and I said no, that my blood pressure isn't the issue and I don't have money to keep driving there (it's about an hour from me), just so they can tell me I'm fine and send me home. This has happened more than once and its very annoying.. as a matter of fact I've been seeing them every 2 weeks pretty much my whole pregnant. She said that was fine and she would tell my doctor but that he now had the right to refuse giving me care. Can they do that? Like I said I'll be 30 weeks and thus far I've had no other problems health wise other than the protein which HAS NOT REACHED preeclampsia levels. I don't see why the protein is such a problem either I've had friends and family with the same issue and their doctors never acted like this. Sorry I know this is long but I tried to look up online and can't find anything. Only about switching doctors which I'm not looking to do. Any advice would be great! Thanks",
