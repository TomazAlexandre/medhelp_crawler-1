            "answer": "Preeclampsia can cause your blood pressure to rise and put you at risk of brain injury. It can impair kidney and liver function, and cause blood clotting problems, pulmonary edema (fluid on the lungs), seizures and, in severe forms or left untreated, maternal and infant death. Preeclampsia affects the blood flow to the placenta, often leading to smaller or prematurely born babies. I was induced at 38 weeks with my first because I was \"flirting\" with it. They'll watch you very closely because it can get very serious very quickly, don't panic it's rare not days for it to go that far. I'm sure if it escalated you'll be induced",

I will be induced at 37 weeks (if I make it that far). I am currently dealing with a headache that has lasted since 3 with 2 doses of tylenol. If it's not gone in the next hour I'm going in to be checked.",
