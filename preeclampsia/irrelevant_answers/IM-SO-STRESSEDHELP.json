            "answer": "You should be enjoying the pregnancy not being bogged with stress!\u00a0\u00a0I would tell both of them..look..I don't need the added stress durring this time..if you start on me I am just going to walk away because you are not thinking of me at all, and appearently I am the only one who is willing to do so. If you want to be supportive and realize I can't deal with anything negative unless it is something I am going through then I am just not going to acknowledge your there. Unless you are asking for advice which may be negative/positive opinions that you asked for. This can be said in nicer terms but I am sure you get the point I am making. Now a days people have too many things going on with themselves and other people bagage just makes it that more overwhelming. I get where your coming from. Either they will understand and apologize and change their ways or they keep doing it which would mean they just don't care enough. I had got high blood pressure/toxima with first child and doctor said to avoid stress. I was on bed rest at the end and family screening the phone calls so I didn't get worked up due to the father threatening me. I hope this helps some:)",

            "answer": "Stress cant cause a miscarriage in the first trimester. You are supposed to try to say un-stressed closer to your due date since it can cause you to go into preterm labor. There have been many studies on it and although stress isn't good for you it doesn't cause you to have a miscarry. Think of the women in Iraq fighting in the war who are pregnant imagine the stress they are under everyday. I was under an enormous amount of stress in the beginning of my pregnancy and was so worried that I called my doctor and asked him if stress could hurt the baby and he said no. Stress has no effect what so ever in early pregnancy.",

            "answer": "Stress really can cause miscarriages despite most doctors dismissing the idea as a myth, according to a study.Although the cause of the majority of miscarriages is never established, they are usually attributed to foetal abnormalities or health problems in the mother.Obstetricians generally do not accept that healthy women can lose healthy babies solely because of stress.But a series of studies carried out by researchers in Germany might change their minds, New Scientist magazine said today.The team showed that when pregnant mice are subjected to loud noises and other forms of stress, they develop hormonal imbalances that turn the immune system against the foetus. In the end, the foetus is rejected.Petra Arck, who led the research, said: \"We can clearly say that stress has a major impact on pregnancy maintenance.\"The biological pathway uncovered by the German team starts with the release of stress hormones such as cortisol.As cortisol levels rise in the bloodstream, they suppress production of progesterone, a hormone critical to healthy pregnancies.This sets off a \"domino effect\" which finally stops the immune system tolerating the foreign cells of the placenta and foetus.To see if the same applied to humans, Arck monitored the progress of 864 pregnant women, taking blood samples and testing them for stress.She found that 55 women who miscarried were more likely to have reported stress than the others.They were also more likely to have lower progesterone levels and other signs of the chain of events putting their pregnancy at risk.Arck was able to prevent stressed mice from miscarrying by giving them an artificial version of progesterone~ just thought id put that on there to i found it int the internet",

            "answer": "Okay, this is totally off the wall, but high stress during pregnancy causes higher testosterone levels in pregnant women, which can cause the boys that they are pregnant with to be gay. Not saying there's anything wrong with that. Just thought it was interesting. My sister majored in Psychobiology and did a paper on it while in college.",

            "answer": "http://www.doctorndtv.com/news/detailnews.asp?id=2060Pregnant women can stop worrying that the stressors and anxieties present in their hectic lives may affect their babies. Recent research suggests that some stress and anxiety during pregnancy may actually be beneficial i.e. mild to moderate levels of psychological distress may enhance fetal maturation in healthy populations.A few previous studies that have examined the impact of stress during pregnancy on child health and development have many flaws, including simply relying on asking mothers how their children behave. Maternal anxiety influences women's perceptions of their children such that stressed women more often report children to be more difficult. This is why in the following study, the researchers focused on objective outcome measures.Researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, USA, studied 137 healthy, pregnant women with low-risk, normal pregnancies and found that those who reported moderate levels of anxiety and stress between weeks 24 and 32 of pregnancy had children who were somewhat more advanced in their mental and motor development at age 2. Overall, the researchers failed to see any ill effects of prenatal stress and anxiety on the children's emotional development and behaviour, based on objective measures.The study found that children of women who reported more negative feelings about being pregnant had somewhat lower behaviour and emotional scores. But, overall, the findings can help pregnant women be at ease and help them \u2018stop worrying about worrying\u2019. This is not to say that they should not remain happy during pregnancy. The reason to avoid stress is because it can be bad for the mothers and it's not a good idea to go into labour/delivery and childrearing exhausted.There is a biological basis that explains the finding that moderate stress is not harmful and may be beneficial for the baby. Chemicals produced by stress have a well-known influence on organ growth and development. Alternatively, it might be a simple genetic transmission and/or an environmental one; women who are stressed in today's world may be the type of women who challenge or push themselves; they may in turn challenge/push their babies to develop faster.",

            "answer": "No stress is not good but it wont have any outcome on the baby. Stress is normal and during pregnancy it is unavoidable and every pregnant women is going to become extremely stressed out sometime in their pregnancy. Pregnancy lasts for 40 weeks and that is a long time to just avoid it. This girl is obviously worried that something might happen to her baby because she is stressed. Stress isn't good for her, its not healthy, and she can take time to calm herself and try to become unwound, but it wont make her miscarry. I highly doubt she came here to hear something along the lines of \"stress could make you miscarry\" when its not a proven fact that it does or that it even causes problems to the fetus. I just think that maybe thinking positive would of helped then making her worry about worrying. I'm not here to fight either I just don't think you should tell someone that it \"COULD cause miscarriage especially it in the first trimester\" when there is no factual evidence.",
