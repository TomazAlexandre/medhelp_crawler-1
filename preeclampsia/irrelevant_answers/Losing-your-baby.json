Try not to worry a lot though you don't want stress on the baby. When I get to stressed about it I do yoga to calm myself down.",

    "question": "I am 19+4. And I just read how someone at 19 weeks lost their baby and someone else at 22 weeks. Just has me so worried. My sister had preeclampsia and lost her son Saren 10 days after he was born. He was 4 1/2 months premature. It just scares me reading about women losing their babies so far into the pregnancy. Scary. Anyone else can relate to this worries feeling? Every time I have an ultrasound appointment I get really nervous hoping my little one is okay. It is devastating hearing these stories. :(",
