            "answer": "I got an epi for my first pregnancy. I was actually trying to go all natural because I heard epidural can slow down the process. I ended up begging for it, and my little man was out in 30 mins. I have a giant lower back tattoo also. As long as it's not a new tat and it's all heeled, the ink from the tatto can't actually get into ur blood despite urban legends :)",

I'm on baby #2 & I'm choosing all natural just because I feel our bodies were made to birth & I do have prolapsed bladder which I believe is from me pushing too hard without feeling anything. I trust my body will help me get thru it at the pace I'm supposed to.",

My mom tells me now that I need to take better care of myself with the second so I can get the epidural. But..... I am not too sure I want to do the epidural I\u00a0\u00a0heard so many horror stories... plus I have a lower back tattoo...what should I do?",
