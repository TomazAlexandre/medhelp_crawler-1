            "answer": "When my son was three months old I got pregnant again and as for my body it was as if it was with the other one not much diff. It has been great they are exactly 11 months apart as my son was born at 32 weeks and he was just fine. It wasn't because of me getting pregnant right after that I had him early I had all my babies early except this one I'm pregnant with now. But the bond between the two is so spectacular that I'm glad God gave us another gift cause those two are inseparable and the things they learn together. Your body is amazing and it will adjust. As for preeclampsia I had that with my first and not with any other just do research on what to drink cause sodas and caffeine can cause preeclampsia so just do research and drink plenty of water you can't get enough. Your body will do fine and I lost the weight and now I'm 36 weeks 5 days pregnant and my son just had his second birthday and my other son will soon be three in Sept. So your body can do amazing things and just be happy cause trust me it's well worth it good luck. If you have any questions please feel free to comment to me. Again congrats and good luck.",

            "answer": "When my son was about 10mths old I fell pregnant again. I had my son at 35wks due to preeclamplsia as well. This time I was considered high risk from the beginning and was able to see my ob at 6wks to start aspirin and calcium. Unfortunately it was picked up again at 15wks this pregnancy but luckily it was picked up early because they were looking for it and have been able to manage it so far with bp meds. So I believe early and regular antenatal appointments are important. Also, my first was a csection and because I didn't give my muscles the whole 12mths to recover, I easily ripped my pelvic muscles picking up my son. And don't forget the rest of your body is still recovering too, I just had surgery yesyerday at 5mths pregnant because of the effects of hormones on your digestive system and damage to my gallbladder and liver. All this with a toddler in tow! Lol. My story may sound like a horror story but my point is don't forget to look after yourself and don't assume it will be like your first! Take care.",

    "question": "I am currently 36 yrs old. I had my first baby via emergency C-section due to PIH escalating to pre-eclampsia in January. He was 4 weeks early but happy and healthy. Now that he is just over 6 mos old I have found out I'm pregnant again. Not truly what my husband and I planned but we are also not getting any younger...any tips for having babies so close together and/or how it affected your body or pregnancy. Any advice would be welcomed. Thanks in advance.",
