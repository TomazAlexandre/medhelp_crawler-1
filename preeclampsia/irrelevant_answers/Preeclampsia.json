            "answer": "Did they do a urine test at all? I wouldnt worry too much if your BP is good, but if you are still worried, have them take a urine sample. Extra proteins and stuff in the urine could tip them off also.What has your BP been like throughout your pg? Even though the number is within normal range, if it is elevated for you specifically, then that is an indication also. Good luck.",

I am glad that your swelling and weight gain have gone down a little (for your sanity)\u00a0\u00a0The great news is that preecclampsia is cured by delivery.\u00a0\u00a0I know of women who have had to delivery babies VERY early because of pre-ecc.\u00a0\u00a0However, since you are 38 weeks IF the doctors felt you needed to deliver, your baby would be very healthy.Just trying to look on the bright side.\u00a0\u00a0:)\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like everything is wonderful now.\u00a0\u00a0Wishing you a happy and pain-free delivery!
