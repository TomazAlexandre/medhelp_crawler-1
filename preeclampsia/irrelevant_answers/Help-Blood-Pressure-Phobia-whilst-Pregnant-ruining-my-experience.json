            "answer": "wow. I also have a history of panic disorder and general anxiety. I know how hard it can be to be off of meds. The battle I fight mainly is no doctor will prescribe anything that will help at all since i'm pregnant. I don't have fear of BP, but I can empathize with the general chain of events over something that should NOT cause the exaggerated overkill response from your body. I hope you can successfully train your mind to stop your body from over reacting like it does. have you tried meditating or hypnosis? they can help a little. good luck",

    "question": "HiNew to this site, but due April 26th this is my 1st. I have a history of panic disorder and OCD. Generally I have been much better for a few years now, and currently not on meds.However had a bad experience when I had my BP taken for the first time at 12 week scan. Was having a panic attack as still get very hyper in doctors etc.. so it was high.I also had a bit of a fear of having my BP taken for some reason, think its because I knew I had to be relaxed so panicked even before as I knew wouldn\u2019t be.Well it was quiet a traumatic event so I brought a home machine in the hope I could do it relaxed at home see my BP normal and chill. This hasn\u2019t been the case. Does not matter how calm I feel as soon as I got to take my BP even at home especially 1st reading my HB rapidly increases and I go into panic mode, reading is high 150 over 80 etc.. then rapidly drops down to around 120\u00a0\u00a0over 70! When my hb reverts back to normal. Thing is this reassures be it is white coat effect.However I have visit tomorrow 20 week scan and I know it will rocket again. I appear to have no logical control over this. Anyone else experiencing the same! I know they look into it seriously and also due to preeclampsia I am just so frustrated with myself. If I have high BP I will have to deal with it, however deep down I do believe I am doing this to myself\uf04c",
