My blood pressure is naturally pretty low so when it gets high for me that's usually normal range for most people. I already have swelling in my hands and feet but I also work a lot so that's out. I have constant migraines that I have to take meds for... that's out too. I'm told they can catch it if the protein levels in your pee is really high though. That's why they **** test you at each appointment. If you're worried you should really call your doc.",
