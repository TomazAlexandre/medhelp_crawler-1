    "question": "I had preeclampsia with my first pregnancy a little over two years ago. Well, I am now pregnant with my second and they were suspecting that I had preeclampsia once again due to some high blood pressure.Just found out.... My blood pressure is normal and I am preeclampsia free! They are gonna keep an eye on us, of course, but what a relief that was to hear! After having had a 4 pound preemie due to preeclampsia, it is such a blessing to know I won't be having it with this one!Also, just found out I am expecting a little mister. :) Already have my girl, so I'm excited to have a little man on the way! Anyone else have a girl and now are having a boy? Anyone else excited about seeing all the differences between the two?I'm just so happy. :)",
