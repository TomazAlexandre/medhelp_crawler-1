            "answer": "How far along are you?\u00a0\u00a0What tests have they done?\u00a0\u00a0I'm assuming your blood pressure is high.\u00a0\u00a0What are your levels?\u00a0\u00a0Have you done the 24 hour urine test?My doctor started worrying about me with preeclampsia at around 20 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure was very high then and I was put on modified bed rest.\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks ago, I was diagnosed with preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0I'm now 34 weeks along.\u00a0\u00a0My BP has been very high and I have protein in my urine.\u00a0\u00a0I'm also having other more serious signs - constant headache, vision problems, etc.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor is very worried about me and says we will need to take the baby early.About a week ago, I was given the beta-methazone steroid shots to help the baby's lungs develop since he will most likely be coming soon.\u00a0\u00a0My bed rest has been moved up to \"VERY strict\" - aka \"no getting up for anything except going to the bathroom.\"\u00a0\u00a0My doctor seems to think is has helped a BIT as my BP levels have gone down some.\u00a0\u00a0But they're still high.\u00a0\u00a0I am going into Labor and Delivery every two days to be monitored until the doc decides it's time to take the baby.As far as what to do for it - there is no cure, except delivering.\u00a0\u00a0If it is severe enough, you will have to have your baby early.\u00a0\u00a0They will either induce labor (if you're far enough along) or schedule a C-section.\u00a0\u00a0Since I am now past 34 weeks, my doctor is going to induce me.\u00a0\u00a0But he's still trying to get me as far along as safely possible.\u00a0\u00a0He's trying to get me to at least 36 weeks.And about what causes it- there have been lots of studies done and most show that nothing \"causes\" it.\u00a0\u00a0Some women get it and some don't.\u00a0\u00a0It's more common with first pregnancies. It's more common if you are under 20 or over 40 . It's more common if you're carrying multiples.\u00a0\u00a0It's more common if you had high bp issues before pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0It's more common if you have diabetes or an auto-immune disease.It's hard to say what will happen for you.\u00a0\u00a0It depends on a lot of factors - mainly how far along you are.\u00a0\u00a0With me and my baby, since we're just a little over 34 weeks, there is a 99% chance he and I will both be fine.Don't worry too much.\u00a0\u00a0Worrying will cause your stress levels to rise, which can be worse for your bp.\u00a0\u00a0Most likely everything will be fine for you and your little bean!Good luck!",

            "answer": "Okay - that helps a lot.\u00a0\u00a0First of all - BEST of luck to you.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you will be like me and, although you have high bp, won't have the high levels of protein in your urine until you get further along.\u00a0\u00a0HOWEVER, if your urine test does come back positive, it will be okay and your doctors will take great care of you.My BP before pregnancy was always on the low side.\u00a0\u00a0Around 20 weeks, it started to get high and the doctor started worrying, so I was put on modified bed rest.\u00a0\u00a0The protein levels in my urine at that time were a LITTLE elevated, but not enough to diagnose me with full on preeclampsia.Do you know the results of your blood tests yet?\u00a0\u00a0They will check your liver enzymes, your platelette levels and signs of kidney problems.\u00a0\u00a0You should know about your 24 hour urine test results tomorrow (will they let you know on a Saturday?).Did your doctor tell you to \"take it easy\" until you find out the results?\u00a0\u00a0I would definitely do that if I were you.Oh - and what are your bp levels at?",
