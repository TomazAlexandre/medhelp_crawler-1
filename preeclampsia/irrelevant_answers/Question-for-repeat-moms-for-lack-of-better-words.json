            "answer": "It is better to go in and it not be labor than not go in and it be full active labor. When is your due date? Are you having a VBAC or another csection? Either way you will do great! For a little push of faith I had a VBAC with my second little one :). Just trust your body and try to put the anxiousness of wanting to meet your little one aside and you will truly know. Good luck!",

    "question": "I'm 37weeks with my second. My first was emergency c-section due to preeclampsia... I was in L&D last night due to contractions 2&3 min apart for approximately 3 hours... increasing in strength. They stated at 3 min. I'm concerned because that is what I thought was the signs to look for and when they checked I was only 1/2 centimeter dialated :-( with no progression for an hour. The doc says don't wait too long to come back as they need to monitor my labor but wait for the contractions to get more severe. Well I have a naturally high pain tollerance and now I don't even trust myself to know when I'm truly in labor. I'm uncomfortable and now worried that I'm not going to know because I don't want to go back just to be sent home! Can anyone help me my mind can't rest and I can't continue like this!! :'(",
