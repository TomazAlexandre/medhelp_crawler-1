I asked my doctor about it last week and he said it was nothing to worry about as long as my blood pressure didnt go up. They also checked my urine for protein and there was none. That is a sign of preclampsia as well. If your concerned, I would call your doctor. I decided a couple months back not to read anymore pregnancy books. The more I read, the more I started feeling the symptoms of everything that could go wrong. I feel that if theres something I need to know about then my doctor will warn me.",

            "answer": "I had severe swelling problem at 36 weeks especially in the morning. My hands were so swollen that I could not even make a fist, and my whole legs were swelling too not just feet and ankles, they even changed color to purple, looked horrible! At that time, my blood pressure went up as well to 146/76, and I gained 3~4 lbs in one week. (I have been gaining 1/2 lb a week consistently). I was really worried. but my Dr. was not concerned. At 37 weeks, my blood pressure did not go up any more, so it was not too bad. now I am 38 weeks. It looks like my swelling is not as severe as when I was 36 weeks. So don't worry. swelling does not necessarily mean hypertension/preeclampsia. But do keep an eye on your blood pressure and urine test.Good luck!",
