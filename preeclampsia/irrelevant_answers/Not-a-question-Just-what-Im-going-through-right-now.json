    "question": "I'm getting induced on the 1st.. I was okay and now I feel like I've been hit by the emotional train. I thought knowing when bub would arrive would be easier but for some reason it's made me feel more anxious, scared and downright emotional. I've not felt or experienced a contraction before so I know I'm in for a shock. My original plan was to go naturally, no pain relief and I still want to do that but I've read being induced is more painful than naturally going into labor. So I'm afraid I won't be able to. My doctor said I'm 1cm dialated and 85% effaced with baby sitting really low so he's sure I can deliver naturally. He said I have a 70% chance of natural delivery and 30% chance of needing a cesarean. He said it's higher for me due to the complications being the reason I need to be induced anyway. I'm on the verge of developing preeclampsia according to him. I've had bad swelling, sore ribs, headaches, visual disturbances. I was missing protein in the urine which they found this week and my blood work (which they've taken every second day) is slowly creeping up, making the doctor worried. I've also got a calcified placenta which has shown by recent ultrasound, bubs belly is small. I thought they would send me for an instant cesarean. I want my baby out but the doctor seems so sure that I will be okay going naturally. I'm just so scared that something will go wrong, bub will get distressed or my body will go into shock from the complications. I'm hoping I can do this, my partner is so very supportive and keeps telling me he won't leave me and reassures me he's there to help me get through it. So I know I'm not alone.. I think its something every mumma goes through but boy am I scared right now. Wishing every mumma out there, the very best in everything you do. Remember, you're amazing.",
