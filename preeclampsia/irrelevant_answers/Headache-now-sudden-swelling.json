    "question": "So i have been getting headaches through out the day. I haven't thought much about them because I have been working and dealing with rude people. But yesterday I was at home and I had a sudden onset of mass swelling in my feet ankles and legs to the point it hurt to walk. Has anyone else had this? I am borderline high blood pressure. And i am worried about getting preeclampsia at only 24 weeks.",
