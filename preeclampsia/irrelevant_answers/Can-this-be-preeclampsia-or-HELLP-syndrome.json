Im 20+4 with my second and i had eclampsia in my last pregnancy and my chances are very high of getting it again, so far so good but its early stage to tell as im only 20+4 and your 18weeks so its very unlikely it could be something else but if i was u go to accident and emergancy or something to get istant answer rather than waiting.

    "question": "I'm 18 weeks today and for the past week-two weeks I have been getting severely dizzy and had constant headaches. My vision gets spotty a lot and sometimes it will completely black out, or my vision will get very bright. I haven't gained any weight this entire pregnancy and was not on any pre-natals until 14 weeks. I will get extremely disoriented to the point that I don't know what is going on around me and can not focus at all. I feel swollen almost all of the time and have been having upper abdominal pain. I am also very sensitive to light and headaches have been lasting for days to weeks at a time. I have felt the baby kick before and lately haven't at all. I just have this really bad feeling that something isn't right.Is this normal? Or does anyone have any ideas of what is going on?",
