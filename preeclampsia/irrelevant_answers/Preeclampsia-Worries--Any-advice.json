            "answer": "Fortunately, PIH or pregnancy induced hypertension, is far more common with first pregnancies, or with children fathered by new partners.So if this is your second pregnancy with the same partner, you might be ok.Unfortunately, having had it once does still make you at increased risk.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor has you doing the correct things.Undoubtably, he will follow your lab work closely, watch your blood pressures, do frequent ultrasounds, and in general pay strict attention to your pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Personally, I feel you should be resting on your left side as much as possible, and we have found some success in women who are simply drinking 2-3 glasses of milk a day during pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0At least, it cant hurt anything!\u00a0\u00a0If you can't drink that much, shoot for 1 glass a day, at least.Best of luck, and keep us posted!",

I had preeclampsia with both pregnancies with the second one being the worst, but I hope and pray you don't experience that again. Since I had it with my first this last time around I really did as much as I could to try and prevent it and nothing helped for me. Good luck. Keep us updated!",

            "answer": "Thank you for you advice. I am actually laying on my left side as much as possible and I will add 2 more glasses of milk.\u00a0\u00a0 The only thing is that my dr isn't really doing frequent ultrasounds. I am 19.3 weeks and only had 3 so far and with my last one they did them every 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I am scheduled for another on May 14...but they said that was for an anatomy check.\u00a0\u00a0I am seeing High-risk doctors at one of the leading hospitals in Philly.\u00a0\u00a0I just thought I would have more freq. ultrasounds.\u00a0\u00a0Oh and I just found out that since I have a high SSA level ( over 1400 in Dec) the baby could develop congenital heart block!\u00a0\u00a0Oh yippie.\u00a0\u00a0 I did question them about seeing me more and they stated that I will see them every 3-4 weeks and u/s as necessary beyond the regular ones.\u00a0\u00a0I guess right now it is a wait and see.",

Now they want to do an U/S every week for the next 4-5 weeks to make sure the baby's heart rhythm is ok. I guess at that point they figure the baby's heart is strong enough . So I am waiting for them to call with my appt for this week.",

    "question": "I had preeclampsia with my last child 3 years ago. He was delivered by emergency C-section @ 28 weeks and lived only a week.\u00a0\u00a0I had signs of it coming a few weeks earlier. Puffy hands, face and feet that wouldn't subside w/ rest and elevation and decreased urination and contractions @ 25 weeks. My urine protein was fine at that point and so was my blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a03 weeks later I went to the hospital b/c my baby wasn't moving as much and my contractions (not painful) were becoming more frequent. Needless to say my bp was 200/120 and my urine protein count was 11 grams.I am now 18 weeks pregnant and scared it might happen again. I am on a Blood thinner, resting as much as possible, eating pretty, drinking plenty of fluids incl. water.Anyone else gone thru this? Any advice?",
