My doctor won't listen when I tell him how this is for me. He keeps saying \"oh it's a little on the high side of normal\". My husband is a paramedic, and he is very concerned about it. If I were you, I would call the doc",

            "answer": "140 is elevated, but 70 is great. I wouldn't worry too much. The bottom number is the more \"important\" one to watch and it's great! I would maybe just give your doc a call and let her know your worried. You can buy a automated bp uff and monitor it at home to make you feel better and the headache could be related but it could also just be dehydration. Try to up your water intake.",

    "question": "My last doctors appointment my blood pressure was at 140/70 she was concerned and said she will check it before I left but forgot well today my heart was racing about 108 bpm and I was short of breath so I laid down then when I woke up which is now I have a huge headache. What should I do? I go to my doctor about everything but really don't want to over react. I'm 28w 2d",
