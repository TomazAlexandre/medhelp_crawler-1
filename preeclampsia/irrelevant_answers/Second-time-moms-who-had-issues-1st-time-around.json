            "answer": "I had eclampsia with my first and preeclampsia with my second. I saw a neonatilologist today because I'm considered high risk. He told me that I am likely to develop some level of preeclampsia so I'm having a blood draw to get a baseline so that my condition can be monitored. I'm 21 weeks now and I just have to wait and see what will happen. My first was delivered at 32 weeks and my second was 37 weeks. Try not to worry but just be aware of what's going on in your pregnancy and be sure to give details to your current provider and have them look over your medical records.",

    "question": "So I'm just thinking ahead considering I'm only 5 weeks along but. ..My first pregnancy I had high blood pressure that only escalated and they waited until the day b4 my emergency c - section to tell me I had pre eclampsia (reason for c - section).Do you think it's likely that bc i was high risk with my first I have a greater chance of being high risk with this one as well? Or any personal experience that can relate?",
