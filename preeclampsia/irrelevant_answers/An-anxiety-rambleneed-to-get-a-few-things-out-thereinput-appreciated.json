            "answer": "Anyway, I went through a period of time that I felt good and ok and never really had any problems..I'd say maybe about a year and a half.\u00a0\u00a0Then, last year in May I began feeling anxious again and one day my sister and I had gone to lunch and I had a panic attack in the restaurant.\u00a0\u00a0I was chewing some food and all of a sudden I just felt like I was going to pass out.\u00a0\u00a0My sister said I was white as a ghost and I felt like I couldn't breathe.\u00a0\u00a0I took an Ativan bc I still had some and I got to feeling better. That instilled in me a great fear of having a panic attack anywhere (because previously I had only had them at home). I started being unable to eat out because I felt like I couldn't make the food go down..had no trouble eating at home at all. Finally went to dr...he put me on Zoloft in May of 2012. I started it and did pretty well with it, started having less anxiety, but had also learned a lot of \"self-help\" things for what to do when I felt anxiety coming on, so in August or September of last year I stopped taking the meds and I did fine until December of 2012.\u00a0\u00a0I was sitting at a baseball practice of my son's and I had turned around to talk to some parents that were behind me and apparently the way that I turned I pulled something in my upper back...like the left side shoulder blade area, to be exact.\u00a0\u00a0For about two weeks I could't even raise my left arm or lean my neck to the side\u00a0\u00a0or anything..it was like a bad \"catch\" was in it.\u00a0\u00a0My shoulder blade would throb and even though I knew that it was stemming from my injury, I would get it in my mind \"what if it is my heart?\" and that would cause horrendous anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0It got to a point where the shoulder injury would also make my left arm hurt in the bicep area..some days it would just throb, but I could also move a certain way and actually feel it pull in that area, so again, in my head I knew it was from the injury, but the way my body reacted to it said otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0So from that has stemmed a great fear of any kind of pain.\u00a0\u00a0If I have a pain that in any way makes me think that it could be my heart then my anxiety goes through the roof.\u00a0\u00a0The zoloft (or maybe just the anxiety itself, though it didn't start til I started taking the zoloft) has caused me to clench my teeth and my jaw has become tight and sometimes I have these fleeting feelings of pain on the left side of my face in my jaw and my body reacts scared like it could be my heart.\u00a0\u00a0Googling symptoms makes me terrified because you find all these unusual stories about heart attacks in women...I mean, one I read said if you feel just nauseas out of the blue that you should go in bc it could be a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0So basically I have started to worry/obsess about that kind of stuff.\u00a0\u00a0The meds are helping me, for sure, but it's still in the back of my mind \"what if?\"\u00a0\u00a0I just turned 37 this month, am 5'3\" and weigh 210.\u00a0\u00a0At one point I weighed around 230 but I have lost weight just by cutting back and eating healthier.\u00a0\u00a0I have never had cholesterol checked at a dr's office bc I have been super scared of them finding something else bad...but I did get up the courage to go to Walgreens about two weeks ago the \"well bus\" was there and they do sugar/cholesterol screening.\u00a0\u00a0My cholesterol was 224, which was a little elevated, but it was a non-fasting test and until I know the actual breakdown of good/bad cholesterol then I don't know if that is a bad reading or not.\u00a0\u00a0My sugar was 97 which they said was great.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure, even though I'm overweight is very good...usually always under the 120/70 range.\u00a0\u00a0I have never smoked.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not on birth control pills.\u00a0\u00a0My dad is 61, Mom is 58, and neither of them have heart issues. I have recently seen where having preeclampsia in a pregnancy can up your risk of cardiac issues,and that did nothing to help my anxiety at all. It's almost like some days I find myself afraid that I am going to have a heart attack and die or either start having bad chest pains and pressure and be really scared and I think about how it would happen and what they would do for me.The other day I had a headache and took a headache powder...well about 45 mins after I got real shaky and my hands were shaking...I attribute this to the dose of caffeine, but the way I felt made me go into full panic mode.\u00a0\u00a0I tried to walk and I shake it off, but I couldn't.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually had to take an ativan to get calmed down.I have no real reason to think that it is my heart...my mom is my person that calms me down and talks me through most of this stuff when I get scared. She has even said as long as this has gone on that if it was my heart I'd be dead by now. She is pretty blunt and calls it like she sees it.Anyway, if you have made it this far, THANK YOU for reading....I am just curious.if any of you go through health related anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0I have mentioned to my mom that maybe I should go to a cardiologist just to let them evaluate me and make sure that everything is fine.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like if I knew it was 100% ok that I would maybe not be as anxious, but she says that is silly bc something is going to kill everyone and most people don't run around going to a cardiologists office unless there is a real reason.Another example of my \"pain related anxiety\" is that about two weeks ago I woke up one morning with my left side hurting just below my ribs...I couldn't think of anything that I did that would make me be sore..it was sore to the touch and it hurt like a pulled muscle.\u00a0\u00a0Then I remembered that I had fallen, but landed on my butt/lower back (I slipped walking down a hill.)\u00a0\u00a0So I googled something like \"what can cause pain below ribs left side\"...well Dr. Google tells me that it could be your spleen, especially if you have taken a fall...so I had extreme anxiety for two days on and off bc of that..and it obviously was NOT my spleen bc I woke up two days later and the pain was gone totally and I think I had just pulled a muscle doing something.I feel totally crazy having put all this out here, knowing that some might judge and say I'm a real nut case..lol..but I opted to take the chance in case someone else is going through or has gone through something like this and can give me suggestions for how to get better. I just want to feel better and NOT obsess about my health and scary scenarios.THanks so much for reading.",

I can relate.\u00a0\u00a0I have always been an axious person as well.\u00a0\u00a0I went to bed one night and just as I was falling alseep BAM I had a panic attack.\u00a0\u00a0I too thought I was dying and I have never been the same since.\u00a0\u00a0I did pretty good for 5 plus years on a small dose of zoloft however, I just upped my dose cuz it came back again.\u00a0\u00a0It has been six weeks and although I am feeling better I am not back to normal yet.\u00a0\u00a0I start therapy in a couple of weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I heard both can do wonders!!! I also run which helps a lot and have found hobbies that I like to do such as read (love reading) and paint ceramics!!! Very relaxing.\u00a0\u00a0I have two kids and am seperated which I am sure doesn't help with anxiety because I feel like I have to be responsible for everything.\u00a0\u00a0It gets overwhelming and I fee lonely.\u00a0\u00a0So I really think you should try therapy.\u00a0\u00a0It takes time to get there, but you have to do what works for you!\u00a0\u00a0:)\u00a0\u00a0This medhelp has helped me a lot and although I don't want anyone else to suffer its nice to know you aren't alone!",

    "question": "I am fairly new here..started Zoloft about a month ago (for the second time)..am currently on 50mg.\u00a0\u00a0I am just curious if any other people can identify with the way that I feel and the things that trigger my anxiety.I was always overly anxious as a child, but never recognized it to be anxiety or panic.\u00a0\u00a0I can just remember being scared at times about something. Like if I had a weird pain in my head I would be terrified that I would die in my sleep.\u00a0\u00a0Once when I was about 8 my parents were both struck by lightening and it happened in front of my sister and I (we had a bad storm and my dad made us all go to the unfinished basement (concrete floor)...at the time my dad's mom lived next door and was very sick and during the storm the phone rang and lightening ran in on the phone and traveled across the floor to where my mom was and hit her too).\u00a0\u00a0They were both fine, but as you can probably imagine, that was TERRIFYING as a child and even now if it is storming I get very scared...to the point of if I get somewhere and it is lightening I am like immobilized in my car...scared to death to get out for fear of getting hit by lightening.At 24, I became pregnant with our first child...in June of 2001, at 24 weeks pregnant, I developed severe preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0I was admitted to the hospital and had steroid shots to help develop his lungs, and I spent the next 13 weeks between home and the hospital on left sided bedrest.\u00a0\u00a0I saw my ob twice a week and was always incredibly anxious when it came time to check my blood pressure because I knew what a bad reading could mean.\u00a0\u00a0The last day of my 36th week my blood pressure hit 220/180 and I delivered a 7 pound baby boy three weeks early.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors weren't very encouraging or optimistic initially about his survival or his health when I was diagnosed so early with preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0So I guess over those 13 long weeks I just almost had it in my mind that he might die and I might not bring a baby home.\u00a0\u00a0Well when I brought him home it felt surreal..like it wasn't supposed to happen..so then I developed a major fear of SIDS and that first year was basically sleepless for me because I kept vigil over his every breath during the night to make sure he was ok.Fast forward six years later, and another baby boy later, my husband's brother passed away at the age of 27 on April 26, 2008.\u00a0\u00a0On April 1, 2008, my mom was diagnosed with thyroid cancer.\u00a0\u00a0(She is fine, thankfully!)\u00a0\u00a0In May of 2008 I had my first panic attack.\u00a0\u00a0I had gone to bed around midnight or so and remember feeling incredibly anxious.\u00a0\u00a0I woke up gasping for breath and having hot and cold flashes and just a feeling of sheer terror. At the time hubby and I were having some real problems and I was scared to death and afraid I was dying and he was just mostly irritable that I had bothered him in the middle of the night.\u00a0\u00a0That was the start of some pretty major on and off anxiety for me.\u00a0\u00a0At the time my doctor just gave me Ativan to take as needed, and later he put me on some Lexapro but my chest seemed to hurt on that...in hindsight, I think it was anxiety causing the chest issues, and the Lexapro just wasn't helping the anxiety.(I got a warning that I had exceeded the 8000 character limit..lol...so my question is continued in comments.)",
