            "answer": "How has your BP been the rest of the pregnancy? With your history and a high reading, you should def be monitored more closely. Are you having any other symptoms such as swelling, proteinuria, headaches,blurred vision, and epigastric pain? Sounds like you should have still had the bloodwork to test for preeclampsia and a 24 hr urine. I'd say if you experience any of the symptoms mentioned above, call your MD right away. If you have a way of checking your BP while at home that would be a good thing to do as well.Another thing you can do that may sound unconventional is call your OB and say you don't feel right and you want to come in for a BP reading...Good luck!",

I do have a blood pressure cuff at home because of this and I have more swelling than usual that I've told them I'm an LNA so I know what I'm doing especially since I've been through this route before I just feel as they're not listening to my concerns and how I feel.",

            "answer": "I would most definitely address your concerns with them. Especially with your symptoms and history, now is not the time for them to ignore your care.You probably already know this, but just make sure you stay very well hydrated. Try drinking electrolyte drinks like gatorade/powerade and dilute them with 50% water. That should help with the swelling and take care of the proteinuria if it's hydration related.Remember to Speak up for yourself,\u00a0\u00a0after all it is your right as a patient.Best of luck to you!",
