            "answer": "That's what me, my bf and my mom thought but they've already discharged me and just said to keep my appointment with my dr next Monday. Idk I just don't feel reassured at all. I mean even if it was just borderline preeclampsia and not definite you'd still think that'd be a good enough reason to keep me especially combined with the fact that my fluid is lower than what they prefer but idk I guess they don't want to be bothered with me. In so frustrated... My only comfort is that I saw my baby on the ultrasound and his heart rate was fine but I'm still so worried and scared... I didn't have any problems like this with my first pregnancy.",

I would call your ob and see if they can fit you in an earlier appointment .",

And they were getting the instructions for this incident tonight directly from her over the phone. So it's like what can I do to get a second opinion since I just don't feel reassured or satisfied with my doctor's \"solutions\".?\u00a0\u00a0I hate to sound whiney or over exaggerating but I feel like it's a pretty big deal to have never had a seizure in my life and then out of nowhere need to be rushed to a hospital by ambulance because of one.!\u00a0\u00a0Ughh it's just so frustrating and I just don't feel like I'll be satisfied until my son is out and healthy.",

    "question": "I have no history of seizures and I am now 38 weeks pregnant. Thankfully my mom was with me and called an ambulance ASAP because she was so scared.\u00a0\u00a0So they got me to the hospital and started to run tests for preeclampsia and did an ultrasound to check on fluid around my baby. They said I only have 6 cm of fluid around the baby and the minimum they prefer is 10 cm. well my blood work came back close to preeclampsia but not positively for sure so they are sending me home. But my question is if they prefer a minimum of 10 cm of fluid around baby and I only have 6 cm can't that hurt my baby.?!?!im just worried that they're trying to get me outta here because they don't wanna deal with me if I'm not in active labor. Sorry it's so long I'm just really worried about my baby boy.!\u00a0\u00a0Please help.",
