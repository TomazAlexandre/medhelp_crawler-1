    "question": "hello everyone!! I went in for my 38 week appointment yesterday and was told I had protein in my urine and my blood pressure was high. This is the first time my blood pressure has ever been high. He sent me home with a jug to pee in for 24 hours and I have to take it back this afternoon to confirm if I have it. I'm just wondering what will happen if I do? He said he'd induce me but I was wondering how they'd monitor me differently? Or if anyone thought they had it and they don't?",
