            "answer": "Thanks. I hope so, b/c worry is eating me alive. I am so worried that I will need a transplant or pass away, and I'm 19.. Just gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. I have been keeping my sodium very low, I try to get below 1,000 mg a day just to be safe. I wasn't eating much at all b/c of fear. But I've been researching on what is safe to eat, and I have been changing my diet to a more healthy one. I have not retained any water.. And I've been keeping my BP under control with my meds, Lisenoprol and Lopresser. I'm just afraid that i will suddenly develop CHF again. I know that I am still considered to have it, but I'm afraid that instead of improving, that I will slip back to where I was before.. It's very scary for me. Thanks for your help. And I'm glad to hear you are back over 50% again. take care.. hope to tty soon",

I'm not retaining water &\u00a0\u00a0my meds are keeping my blood pressure lower than normal. Docs say that my blood pressure being a little low will give my heart a chance to repair itself. But, the sorness is not a pain or doesnt feel like its stabbing me. It's just a little sore when I take a super-deep breath. Could this be a sign I'm retaining water in my lungs again, or could it be associated with my recent CHF? Everything else seems to be recovering well.",

I was not sure what my E.F. was until my cousin looked up my medical records online today, she works at a doctors office. She said that on my last echo my E.F. was 47%. That made me feel a little better, b/c although its low, there is a chance of recovery. Is 47% still a pretty bad number? I am so willing to do whatever it takes to get my healthy heart and normal life back.",
