            "answer": "The hospital I was at when I had my first let me stay even though I had been discharged. She wasn't in nicu though so we were able to stay in the same room bc I wasn't going anywhere without my baby and they knew it. Lol... I forget what the technical term for it is, but it was almost like I was her visitor and could sleep in the room with her and\u00a0\u00a0they even still gave me meals and everything even though they didn't have to do that part. I know that other hospitals offer renting rooms as well so you can stay and be with babe, but idk how much something like that would run, just wanted to share that with you in case you wanted to look into a way to stay with baby. But sounds like he is doing great and will be home with you soon regardless. Good luck and congrats on your new bundle of joy!! :-)",
