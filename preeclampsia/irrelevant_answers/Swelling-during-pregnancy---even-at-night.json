    "question": "I am starting to swell at night and it is freaking me out. My feet sometimes swell during the day but for the past few nights my hands are swelling up and they burn. Tonight they are keeping me up. I am 33 wks and I saw the OB on Wed. and my blood pressure is great so he said I did not have preeclampsia. The swelling in the hands goes down a couple of hours after I wake up in the morning but that is doing me no good right now. The baby is also very active right now.Any advice on what to do at night? I plan on calling the Dr. again but I am getting very anxious over the whole thing.",
