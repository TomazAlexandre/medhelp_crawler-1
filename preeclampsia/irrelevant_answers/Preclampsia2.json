            "answer": "So she checked my urine, but there was no protein in it so she said that was a good sign. Sent me for blood tests and a CTG but the results came back okay.. my question is, they've gotten slightly worse since my last appointment. Even though things were fine, do I still have a chance of getting it? I think she said she will be worried when I show signs of protein in my urine. It's just worried me a bit.. could I be in the early stages of getting it or no? Ftm & 35w6d. Any help will be appreciated and sorry for the long post x",

            "answer": "Maybe, but without the protein it could be gestational hypertension which is basically the same symptoms as preeclamplsia but without the protein. This is my second time with preeclamplsia and its really tough, the swelling is excessive especially in the face and hands and blood pressure needs to be over 140/90 on two separate occassions at least a couple of hours apart to be considered high. I'm sure your midwife will keep an eye on you especially as you are so close now! Wishing you and baby all the best.",

My face has also started to swell under my chin, my eye lids are swelling and today my hands swelled for the first time. I've had a couple of days where my vision gets a little blurry. I checked my bp on a kmart self check stand and it was normal. I asked my nurse about it and she said some swelling was normal... thankfully I have an appointment friday. I hope all is well with you!",

    "question": "Hi lovely lady's. I'm just wondering if anyone can give me some answers or know anything about this. At my most recent routine doctors appointment (a week ago) my midwife took my blood pressure and she said it was quite high. She then asked how I had been and I explained to her that I had started to swell in my feet and hands and it was so noticeable, my partner picked up on it without me having to tell him. I also told her I had been suffering from some bad headaches that resulted in spots in my eyes. I also told her about my severe heartburn that sometimes left my chest in so much pain that I couldn't do anything to soothe it. She turned to me and said these were all normal things in pregnancy but added together with high BP, it could be a sign of preeclampsia.",
