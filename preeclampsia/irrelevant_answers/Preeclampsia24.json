            "answer": "I hope this isn't too personal, but you said you had PE with your 2nd baby. Was that 2nd baby with the father of your 1st baby also? The reason I'm asking is that I got PE with my first child. I don't really remember the symptoms, but I was young-just 18. I went in for a routine check up and my reflexes were hyper-BP way up and protein in my urine. I look back at pictures of myself right around that time and I am severely swollen. I didn't have a clue though! I just thought it was pregnancy in general, not a problem. I did not have it with my 2nd, 3rd or 4th child, all with the same father. But I am pregnant with my 5th child and I have been told that I again have a chance of having PE because this child is with a different father. I am just curious about it.",

            "answer": "My first was with my 1st husband....I was 33 then... I remarried and had my DD at 41 and my DS at 43. I do remember a nurse asking me the same question while in the hospital with DD. I had forgotten about it but she said that some research suggests that the father can have something to do with it. I dont know but I had my 1st son at 34 weeks due to premature rupture of menbranes and my DD was born also at 34 weeks due to the PE. It got really bad...was in the hospital for 7-9 days before I was induced. I never got my normal bp back again after that and had to go on bp meds. IWhen I got preg. with the last baby I was monitored carefully...meds upped as I progressed and I made it to 36 weeks. No PE but I did have the high bp I had with DD...the dr said the risks were the same and the treatment basically the same. The last time around the only difference was no protein in the urine...I do believe that my aggresive monitoring got me to 36 weeks this time...without it I'm sure I would have progressed to PE rapidly and had another premature low birth weight baby....my DD is fine she was 4lb 10ozs my son was 7lb 11ozzs at 4 weeks early! with the high bp...my experience is to err on the cautionary side and treat early so that the outcome is more likely to be good.....:)",

    "question": "I was just wondering if anyone that has, or had, preeclampsia could tell me what your physical symptoms started out as. My hands, feet, and ankles are swollen and the swelling doesn't go down after resting. Procardia helped keep my blood pressure normal for around a week, but now the medication is not keeping it down. Today it was 131 over 100, and my doctor said the bottom number is the important one to watch. I am starting to get head aches more frequently, and last week I gained 7 pounds. I go to the doc tomorrow, but I am really worried and was wondering if anyone knows anything I don't...!",
