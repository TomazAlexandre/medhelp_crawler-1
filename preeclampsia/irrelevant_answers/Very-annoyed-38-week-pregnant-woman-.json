    "question": "Starting about 2 weeks ago my blood pressure started to be high and my midwife started to make me go in for check ups 2x a week. Each visit they did a urine test and blood work to see if I was getting preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0Well I was feeling fine until this week when I started to have a severe headache, spotty vision, daily vomiting,\u00a0\u00a0and sharp pains under the right side of my rib. My lab work kept coming back normal but my blood pressure kept rising. So they made me do a 24 hour urine test and they did find protein in that and the day I went in I still had high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0My midwife sent me to l&d to be monitored, in the end they just sent me home because my blood work wasn't elated enough for them to induce me. I'm very angry now\u00a0\u00a0because they have made me go to l&d 3x now to be monitored and they have done nothing. I still have symptoms and they aren't resolving them and I'm sick of spending every other day in l&d for them to do nothing.Sorry for being so long.",
