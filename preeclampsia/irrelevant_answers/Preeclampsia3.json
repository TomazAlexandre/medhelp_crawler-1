            "answer": "I was told that it would not happen the 2nd time but it did, and then the doctors said that if they thought it was going to happen they could have tried to prevent it. I am hoping that they will monitor me more closely this time around, and do something to try to help me go full term. 2 different doctors told me that it is usually just a one time thing, but now since it happened to me again chances are it will happen again, but you may not have the same problem. They were really shocked that it happened to me the 2nd time. Just make sure that they monitor you well and the asprin probably wouldn't be a bad idea just to be on the safe side. I have my first appointment tomorrow so I am hoping they will do something or at least say something to help ease my mind...lol preeclampsia is a horrible thing. I felt like I was never gonna be the same... Thank God I was wrong :o) Goodluck!!",

            "answer": "Went to the doctor. She told me that if the babies have different fathers it greatly decreases the chance of having preeclampsia again. She said that sometimes preeclampsia is your body rejecting the fathers sperm ??? Never heard of this but thought it was interesting!!",

    "question": "I just found out that I am pregnant with my third child. With my first pregnancy I had severe preeclampisa and delivered at 31 weeks. With my second I had severe preeclampsia and hellp syndrome and delievered at 30 weeks. Is there anything I can do to prevent this from happening again?? My doctor told me after my second pregnancy that if I became pregnant again she could put me on blood thinner that could possibly make me go full term. I haven't seen the doctor yet, but I have an appointment. Has anyone else had these problems, or know any answers??? Thanks! :o)",
