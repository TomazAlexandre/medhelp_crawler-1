How far along are you?\u00a0\u00a0I know swelling, headaches, and blurry vision along with high blood pressure are all symptoms of pre eclampsia. When you go back you need to express how you've been feeling and in the mean time if you get any symptoms go to the er. Good luck",

I would definitely look into the other midwife you saw or a Dr because preeclampsia is serious for both you and baby if not monitored and controlled. I don't mean to frighten you but it is a lot of symptoms and you are not over reacting",

    "question": "Ive been having some swelling for about two weeks. Ive been telling my doctors but they said its normal. My blood pressure is usually around 110/60. Ive kept a headache but towards 3ish when i start to swell really bad i get a headache so bad it feels like my head is swelling and i get so dizzy i have to lay down. Today I had an appointment with a different midwife then i usually see. My blood pressure was 130/90, the nurse said that was high. I told the midwife how ive been swelling and always have a headache and that my blood pressure was high. She was pretty rude and said that it was normal, only time to be worried is when i have a headache, i tried to explain to her i keep a really bad headache but she just said come back and two weeks and left. Anyone know what the signs are for preeclampsia or what to do?",
