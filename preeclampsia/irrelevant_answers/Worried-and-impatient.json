But i was active and just moving around like any other day. My feet were pretty swollen, I don't think it made things worse. But you should get your doctors opinion.",

    "question": "Okay, so just recently I was diagnosed with mild preeclampsia and told to be on light bedrest. I have been pregnant many times before but unfortunately this pregnancy has been the worst. I am almost 38 weeks on Sunday and just really want to have this baby and get things started. If my ankles are swollen, can I still walk alot to move things along? My appointment is tomorrow with my OB as well as an appointment at the hospital for fetal monitoring again and I take public transportation so I know I'm goin to have to be on my feet alot. I just don't want to do anything that might harm the baby or myself.",
