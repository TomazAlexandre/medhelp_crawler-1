I don't think I feel fetal movement, that would be impossible from the conception date..but I did read about uterine fibroids that are extremely simular to pregnancy symptoms.Who knows..the ultrasound will show what's going on or show that absolutely nothing is going on. ....hoping for the nothing going on lol",

            "answer": "Your cycles will be very messed up after giving birth. Give your body time to regulate. If you keep experiencing this next month you could request a sonogram (it's your money). My personal opinion is that you're not pregnant. It's common to feel \"phantom baby movements\" after giving birth. They are bowel movements/gas, nothing more.",

Those could have turned into uterine fibroids. I was never checked after I had my baby.I'll request for an ultrasound, but you don't pay for them here, so why not.Thanks",

    "question": "Hi there,I have the following going on:I had a baby 8 months ago. He was 7 weeks premature due to preeclampsia. I'm breastfeeding only occassionally and bottle feeding mostly/solid foods and always was except for when he was in the hospital for 2 months (pumping milk every 3 hours).So my first period was mid April 2009. Then I missed my supposed to be next period in May..it just never came the whole month. I thought for sure I was pregnant because from my first, I know how it feels. I had cramping daily, bloating to the point where I looked 4 months (mostly at the end of the day, like with my first) a few times feeling sick but never throwing up (just like my first), headaches, lower back ache etc so on.So I took home pregnancy tests and they all show up negative. I decided to make a doctors appointment to make sure something else wasn't up with my abdomen because you never play waiting games with stuff like that (I was very bloated).The night before my doctor's appointment on June 5th I got a very heavy period that lasted 2 days, then turned into very bright red bleeding. My doctor told me to come back because there was no point in checking me. So 4-5 days later I come back and I'm still cramping lightly and I still have back aches and bloat and etc...he ordered me a blood test for pregnancy and still negative. I'm worried something else is wrong. I feel weird movement in my lower abdomen and the bloating seems to be harder and not really going away.I want an ultrasound now..I feel pregnant but I guess maybe I'm not.What's going on?",
