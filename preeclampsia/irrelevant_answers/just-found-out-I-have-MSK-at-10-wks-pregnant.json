            "answer": "A good alternative to using cranberry is something called D-Mannose.\u00a0\u00a0This is the sugars in the cranberry that prevent the infections from attaching without the acids which are an issue to me and the oxaltes too!\u00a0\u00a0I use the crystals and have found the one from NOw through vitapal as the most reasonable.In truth diet can help but with MSK stones are formed more because the defect in our collecting system does not allow the urine to drain properly.\u00a0\u00a0Keeping your kidneys flushed out is the most important thing we can do!\u00a0\u00a0Distilled water is best since it does not contain the lime or minerals other waters contain that can increase our problems.(We have a softener and reverse osmosis.)MSK being connected with pre-eclapmsia?\u00a0\u00a0Does not make much sense.\u00a0\u00a0Pre-eclampsia is cause by the position that the placenta attaches.\u00a0\u00a0This usually means that it attaches too close to the cervix so when you start dialating the placenta comes first.\u00a0\u00a0This would be found on an ultrasound early on and a c-section would most likely be the scheduled mode of birth.It could possibly be connected with an increase in toxemia, since that is the increase in proteins in your urine etc. and causes toxins to build up in your body.\u00a0\u00a0I have had 5 natural births without issues, MSK is something your born with and I have stones in all my pregnancies.\u00a0\u00a0There are ways to prevent toxemia, drinking plenty of water!!!\u00a0\u00a0Also eating complete proteins.\u00a0\u00a0What that means is not relying on too much meat for your proteins but including brown rice and beans etc in your diet to balance the protein levels in your body so more are absorbed.The biggest problem I had in all my pregnancies was infections.\u00a0\u00a0In my first pregnancies it was bad enough that they put me on a low dose antibiotic throughout the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0In the last tow we avoided infection mainly by drinking lots and lots of water or caffeine free healthy herbal teas.\u00a0\u00a0The D-Mannose is also a natural way to prevent pregnancies.It is very important though that you are under a doctor's care during your pregnancy to prevent problems, and always discuss with them anything you take including naturals!I hope this gives you some assurance and direction.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck with your pregnancy and keep us posted on how you are doing!Shelly",

My doctor was more scared than I was going into pregnancy with Hailie my daughter who is now 6! healthy as a horse and no complications throughout my pregnancy even though I battle with Rheumatoid Arhritis, Firbro, and MSK, during my pregnancy I passed stones. I had to get off all my meds except prednisone. I did have re curent UTI infections. I HAD NO ADVISE, NO PAIN MEDICATION GIVEN AND WOULDNT HAVE TAKEN IT HAD IT BEEN PRESCRIBED,...BUT I REALLY REALLY WANT TO RESPOND TO mornings1st light about the water issue. HATE IT RIGHT! YOUR NOT ALONE ...I KNOW what your thinking...WATER IS AWFUL NASTY ...... (OFF TOPIC) FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T SEEN BABY MAMA, THE BLONDE WHO SPEWS OUT THE DRINK SHE'S BEEN GIVEN.......

I HATE WATER, AND I REALIZE THAT IS ALOT OF MY ISSUES........ BUT YOU ASKED WHAT IS THE BEST SOLUTION FOR THIS AND IVE BEEN MEANING TO POST THIS. OK. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND IM NOT A DOCTOR BUT THIS IS WHAT I HAD TO DO DURING PREGNANCY AND STILL TO THIS DAY . OK. 1. I AM OFFICIALLY A DR PEPPER JUNKIE, DONT DRINK COFFE, BUT\u00a0\u00a0I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT CAFFEINE UNFOURTUNATLY DURING PREGNANCY I DID AND EVERYONE AROUND ME PAID FOR IT. :) BUT I DRINK PROPEL LIKE IT IS GOING OUT OF STYLE. I BUY THE PROPEL SHAKERS. AND PUT IT IN MY WATER BOTTLES AND DRINK AT LEAST FOUR BOTTLES OF THIS A DAY . I LIKE GRAPE PROPEL. THAT'S JUST MY PREFERENCE, THEY HAVE LEMON AND BERRY I JUST LIKE GRAPE DONT KNOW WHY AND GET THIS THE MAIN INGREDIENT. IS CITRIC ACID, SODIUM CITRATE,AND POTASSIUM CITRATE! THAT'S ALL WHAT WE ARE PRESCRIBED TO LIMIT OUR STONES, BUT NOT ALL CAN TAKE THIS IN HIGH DOSES..... BUT I THINK THE MAIN FOCUS IS HYDRATION, IT CANT HURT ONLY HELP THE KIDNEYS AND THE PREGNANCY.I CANNOT TAKE THE HIGH DOSES OF THE UROCIT K ANY LONGER BECAUSE I HAVE FOUND THAT IT INCREASES MY INFECTION ISSUES.BUT HOPE THE PROPEL MAY HELP AID IN YOUR WATER DRINKING IM THE SAME WAY IT HAS TO BE FREEZING COLD THE ONLY WAY I CAN TOLERATE IT IS WITH THE PROPEL I CAN DRINK IT HOT LIKE THAT AND REALLY ENJOY IT THAT'S JUST ME. I LIKE CRYSTAL LIGHT STRAWBERRY ALSO BUT THAT CONTAINS A VERY VERY VERY HIGH DOSE OF CAFFEINE AND WOULDNT RECOMMEND THAT FOR PREGNANCY MSK PERIOD. I ONLY DRINK THAT WHEN I REALLY NEED AN ENERGY BOOST AND AND TRYING TO COUNT CALORIES. I ALSO LOVE ICED TEA, THAT'S ANOTHER FLAW... IM TRYING TO LIMIT, IVE LIMITED MY CAFFEINE TO 1. D.P. IN THE MORNING, OR I REFUSE TO GET OUT OF BED, AND ONE GLASS OF ICED TEA FOR A TREAT FOR BEING GOOD ONCE IVE DRANK AT LEAST THREE BOTTLES OF WATER THAT DAY. MY PROPEL I CONSIDER WATER.. :)\u00a0\u00a0THAT'S JUST ME AND LIKE I SAID IM NO DOC. I JUST WANT TO HELP IN ANY WAY TO RE INFORCE THE WATERAND ASSURE YOU YOUR PREGNANCY WILL BE A SUCCESS...

However when they did a research study, they actually found that if people just increase their fluids, they usually go for drinks high in sodium.\u00a0\u00a0This would include gatorade. soda etc.\u00a0\u00a0What they learned is a high sodium intake actually increases stones!\u00a0\u00a0Soda also should not be limited in pregnancy but it should not be over done either.\u00a0\u00a0Over doing the sodium can also increase risk for toxemia etc.Just something to think about when we increase our fluids to make sure we are doing it with things that help nor hurt stone formation etc.Shelly",

            "answer": "Hi thereI have MSK in my right kidney and I am 34 weeks pregnant with my second child.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a urine infection now for about 4 weeks and have completed 3 courses of antibiotics, but at the end of each course the infection will flare up again. I was supposed to start a low dose antibiotic to take for the rest of my pregnancy, but I cant get rid of this initial infection in order to start this treatment. I was wondering if you would have any advice for me as I am starting to get quite anxious.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I am under midwifery lead care this pregnancy, meaning fewer hospital appointments. Do you feel I should be monitored more closely than this?Many ThanksCara",

            "answer": "Writing you again lol :) I read her comment and saw what you posted and yes, I believe that is true about diet not being able to prevent stones; it can in the case of kidney stones but not when you have MSK I believe, as you said. My urologist initially told me to collect my stones to see what foods I could stop eating to prevent them, but then told me it was pointless because I had MSK and they will come back no matter what I stop eating, and that (as you also said) the thing everyone keeps telling me, which is to drink lots of water through the day.Not to sound completely stupid, but is distilled water pretty much any water you buy in bottles? I shouldn't be drinking tap water anyway I'm sure just for health in general, but really hate dealing with these stones and issues and will do ANYTHING to try and prevent it...You are obviously very knowledgeable on this topic and honestly I have seen more care and consideration from you to others on here than I have got from my own doctors lol. My urologist saved my life when I first discovered I had stones because I was so infected I was septic, rushed into hospital at 8am with fever and pain and had to be operated on immediately, stent and whole deal, and I wouldn't get better and they didn't know why.. they discovered after that I had stones and had an infection that got so bad my body couldn't even fight it off (I was only about 21 then)... pretty scary stuff.. then to find out it's something you can never get rid of like regular stones for most people, but I am trying my best to cope! It's been lithotripsy at least once a year which I hate doing but the doctors there are fantastic.... but yea after babbling here my big question this time was --- should I still get my stones tested to determine what kind they are? I believe he told me he thought that I produced two different types of stones (there are three altogether of possible types of stones I believe)... but he never ended up actually testing them... he just didn't test them because he said you can't stop MSK stones with diet changes... but should I still determine to see what type (s) my stones are (bc of comments I see on the forum regarding diet.. I'm a bit confused about that does it really matter what you eat depending on the type of stones you have even if you have MSK and they will basically come back no matter what?? (I've asked my doctors this many times but it doesn't seem anyone cares to offer a straight answer or even an answer at all)... and also if I should get them tested, I suppose you can only collect stones right after lithotripsy right? Thanks so much in advance it feels very good knowing I will at least get some sort of a response from someone who understands!!!",

            "answer": "1. No stilled water or purified water is different from Spring water in that the minerals are removed.\u00a0\u00a0For us Tap water depending on where can be very high in calcium or LIME, this can increase our stones and be an issue. You can have your water test, used a reverse osmosis water softener etc. or buy purified or distilled water.As far as stones, having them tested isn't a bad idea... knowing the type can help some and even more importantly if you can get them cultured. Knowing the types of bacteria in your stones as well as the makeup will not prevent all stones but can keep them from quickly and limit new ones. MY stones have not increase in years because of this. I do not really watch my diet so much but for me do limit calcium and do not take supplements. Knowing the type of bacteria that are within your stones can help you to keep them at least calm. So basically all things help a little but are not the cure for us that they are for other stone formers.Hope that helps some.",

    "question": "I just found out that I have MSK because I had my second episode of kidney stones a few days ago.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors discovered it about 4 and 1/2 years ago when I had my 1st episode and failed to mention it back then.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is that I am 10 wks pregnant, and have done some research, and found it may increase chances for me to develop preeclampsia in pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I was shocked to find that this second attack could have been prevented by a change in diet, and shocked that I was not told of my condition before. I am going to see a specialist in the near future about this, just waiting for my referral.\u00a0\u00a0I discovered in my research that cranberry juice is bad for those of us with this disorder, and wouldn't you know it, prior to both incidents I was drinking it like crazy!\u00a0\u00a0While I wait for my appointment, does anyone know anything more about what else is bad or good for us? thank you",
