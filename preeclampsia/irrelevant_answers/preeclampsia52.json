            "answer": "It's high bp that leads to stress on your kidneys and can cause them to not functioning properly. This leads to the kidneys not filtering properly and there'll be extra protein output in your urine meaning baby is not getting the protein it needs from you making it it gain weight properly. Also with high bp you are at risk for heart attacks or strokes. If not treated it leads to full blown eclampsia which can cause you to have seizures. It is very important to seek help if there are symptoms of preeclampsia.",

It wont say this on the computer,\u00a0\u00a0but if you get 80 to 90grams of protein a day your chances of getting it are very small. Its from not eating right even though they will say no one knows what causes it. But there have been studies done to prove it.",

Iwas extremely fit and healthy last pregnancy but for whatever reason I didnt grow a good placenta for my baby so he started to take from my nutrients which put pressure on my kidneys whick leaked proteins my kidneys couldn't process leading to high blood pressure. I had it badly and as my liver and placenta started to burn out my baby stopped growing so they did a csection at 35wks. While they can't stop the preeclamplsia they can slow it down with aspirin, calcium and blood pressure tablets. I wont be going full term again but am hoping to get as far as possible for babies lung development.",

Idk if there I'd a specific pain associated with preeclampsia aside from the massive headaches associated with the high bp. There may be liver or kidney pain if it'd fine unchecked for a while buy it just sounded like your baby growing and pressing against your ribs. If you ate still concerned you should definitely talk to your doc about it. But if y pop bp is normal at your appointments and you don't have headaches preeclampsia shouldn't be a big concern for you.",
