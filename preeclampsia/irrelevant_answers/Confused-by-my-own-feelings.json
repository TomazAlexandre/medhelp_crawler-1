            "answer": "Dear Deep Thinker,Before addressing the question of \u201cstay or go\u201d you\u2019ll have to figure out how viable the situation is. It may be that your man is frightened to death of the responsibilities of parenthood and all that it involves, and has regressed to his worst, most adolescent state. So he may come out of it. Or he may be messed up, alcoholic or stuck in a pattern of childish irresponsibility that won\u2019t go away for a long time, if ever, and that leads to the conclusion that he is a loser as a practical matter.I\u2019d start by telling him that things aren\u2019t working as is, and that you know it\u2019s hard to adapt to grownup life, and here are some ways to go to get help with that (discussion of needs, parenting group, psych help, etc). If that doesn\u2019t work, and he remains in denial and doesn\u2019t change, I\u2019d let him know that you won\u2019t put up with it indefinitely. Note that he may change while denying that he\u2019s doing so; men will do that. If that doesn\u2019t work, and he gets nastier, or more controlling, slacks off more, or disappears more often, I\u2019d begin to plan a separation. This would make increasing sense if his drinking really becomes DANGEROUS, to you and/or your child. If this happens, leave.In the process of all this, don\u2019t forget to take a look at your own part in the problem. Maybe it\u2019s nonexistent in your case, but sometimes a new mother can either behave weirdly toward her man, due to hormonal shifts, or just let the relationship lapse.In any case, you do indeed deserve more. So take these graded steps, test him out and educate at the same time, and see what happens. I don\u2019t know how old either of you are, and if you\u2019re both young, it may be that he just doesn\u2019t know how to operate in the adult world. Women mature way earlier than men. Alternatively, he could have deep and enduring personality issues. We don\u2019t know yet, and your job is to find out, over the medium term. It\u2019s the only way to answer the \u201cstay or go\u201d question in a reliable way.Sincerely,Dr.P.",

            "answer": "...I keep looking at my baby's face and saying to myself, this isn't good enough for us. I love his Dad. I know it sounds cliche but he's a really good person. But I'm afraid that if I keep waiting for him to blossom into his full potential, maybe I'll be greeted with the disappointment of \"some things never change\". I was supposed to be successful in my life. I've always had that spark in me. I know in the core of my being that I was meant to do great things and to experience great love and this is just not good enough. Will it ever be, I don't know.. Should I stay or should I go?",

    "question": "I've been in a relationship for almost two years. We have a 6 month old baby together. In the beginning, we had lots of fun together. I can still have fun with him but that's where things seem to stop short for me.\u00a0\u00a0There are so many \"little things\" that I feel are wrong with our relationship. I'm done trying to communicate my feelings to him cause whenever I voice how I feel it becomes a me vs. him battle & ultimately, nothing changes between us. I'd have to say, that on average, I contemplate ending the relationship at least 2-3x a month.. if not 2-3x in a \"bad\" week.\u00a0\u00a0My issues with him are things such as; He was coddled well into adulthood (up until the pregnancy) by his parents and this transcends into all areas of his life, he is not self-reliant, he does not 'think' for himself, he has unrealistic ideas about how adulthood should be, his mother is mean to me and he refuses to stand up to her cause that's \"just the way she is\", he doesn't help me take care of our responsiblities, he contirbution to our household is way less than 50% & so I contstantly feel busy trying to pick up the slack.. he drinks pretty much every day and often he gets so drunk he poses a hazard to himself and indirectly to me and/or our baby.. I feel so much resentment towards him for things like he's been a factor in driving a wedge between me and certain members of my family (he doesn't like them), My pregnancy was not easy on me or the baby, I had preeclampsia (hypertension) but looking back I feel like he made things worse for me, Even though I was pregnant, he wouldn't help me life something heavy, he never rubbed my feet or pulled out my chair, he didn't rely on me any less and I think he may have cheated while I was pregnant but I can't prove it..\u00a0\u00a0There's so much more I could tell you..\u00a0\u00a0But here's the thing..",
