    "question": "Owen Lachlan was born at 9:00 pm on September 29, 2013 by emergency c-section.I went in at 5:00 pm on September 28 to start my induction due to preeclampsia. At 7 am the pitocin was started. By 8 am on the 29th I was 3cm and 70% effaced. My doctor broke my water and I started having severe contractions and by 10:30 am I was at 5cm and 70% effaced and they started my epidural. They upped the pitocin but Owen responded badly and they had to lower it. Over the next 10 hours I made no progression and my doctor determined Owen was stuck in the birth canal. By 8:30 pm I was wheeled into the OR for an emergency c-section. At 9:00 pm Owen was born. I was back knto my room for recovery at 9:30 pm. Owen was placed on my chest where he latched and fed for over an hour.",
