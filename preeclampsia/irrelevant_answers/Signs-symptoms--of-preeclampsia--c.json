            "answer": "If u had preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy, ur chances of having it with this pregnancy increase. With preeclampsia u have protein in ur urine, increased BP, headaches, spots flashing before ur eyes. I just delivered at 32 weeks due to preeclampsia. When I went to my prenatal visits,my BP was normal. I was also seeing a neonatologist because my baby girl was small, every time I saw the specialist my BP was up. I did a 24 hour urine collection, and I had protein in my urine. Was admitted, protein/BP continued to increase but I had no other s/s. After being in the hospital for several days with BP still high, my liver enzymes started to increase(the preeclampsia was getting worse). At that point the specialist decided to do a c section because it was no longer healthy for me or my baby girl. She was delivered 4-22-12 and weighed 2#13oz(she was small due to the preeclampsia)other than being small, she is doing GREAT. So get that checked out.",
