            "answer": "It is absolutely possible to go into early labor with first. I went into labor at 19 weeks with the first one and 20 weeks with the other 2. I was put on meds and bedrest to keep from having them too early. My medication stopped working at 36 weeks and I was induced (since the meds had caused my contractions to not be as hard as they needed to be) by being put on a pit drip and breaking my water. I delivered my first child in 3 hours. So, again, it is definitely possible.",

            "answer": "Because it's your first baby? I went into early labor with my daughter at 30 weeks they stopped it. Again at 32 and again ay 36. I finally had my baby at 38 weeks. And yes this was my first.\u00a0\u00a0You honestly need to focus on yourself and baby. Don't worry about what anybody has to say. Early labor is scary. But just one more week and baby will be considered full term. Good luck :)",

    "question": "So I'm 36 weeks and 4 days, and I went to the doctor today, and she thinks I am already in early labor and thinks I might have the baby thus week. She also told me that if I didn't have the baby by 38 weeks she would probably induce me because I am showing signs of preeclampsia. Well my fiances familly is very supportive and very excited, and my family has nothing to say except negative comments. Like how stupid it would be to get induced and how there is no way I'm going into early labor, because it's my first baby. I don't understand and I'm just getting really frustrated.",
