            "answer": "congrats on your little guy.i had an eclampsic seizure after my c-section with my son 6 weeks ago. i was put on Magnesium Sulfate too. That stuff SUCKS!!!! I had to have it for 24 hours (i'm pretty sure- if it wasn't 24 hours it sure as heck felt like it). By the end of that I was biting the nurses heads off- not too effectively either because I was so dang tired. Sorry to hear you had an ordeal but I'm sure little Joshua is more than worth the trouble. I know Conner is. :o)",
