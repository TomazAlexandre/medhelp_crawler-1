I don't know about the hearbeat, but mine was 79 the other night when I checked it at WalMart.I guess maybe I should have brought this up BEFORE you went to the store! lol But, you can buy the strips that they use at the doctor's office to check your urine for protein. My pharmacy has them for 50 cents a strip and you can also get the ones that check for sugar/glucose/whatever in the urine too.And I may be stupid....but I didn't know REAL contractions came up high into your uterus. If that's the case, I think I've had a few. I get reeeeeally big waves of ache right below my ribs lately and was wondering what was happening. Maybe it is contractions...hmmm! lol I thought they were more like the cramps that you are having!
