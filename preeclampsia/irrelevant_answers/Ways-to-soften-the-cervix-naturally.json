            "answer": "at 35 weeks braxton hicks contractions can be very regular and stron and canbe mistaken for the real thing, even the doctors can get mistaken\u00a0\u00a0by them. Do thewy settle down once you have had a warm shower or bath? If so then they will be braxton hicks.\u00a0\u00a0Raspberry leaf T is exceelent so your on the right track there, the problem you face is that your body is not yet ready, so you could try reflexology or acupucture. Most of the natural remedies only really work if you are around you due date but you could give those last 2 a try and see how you go, good luck",

            "answer": "hey sweetiedon't worry, must of us understand completely why you're trying to ripen your cervix right now - if you have severe preeclampsia, the typical rules for \"too early to be trying to induce labor\" just don't apply to you..so you don't need to justify yourself! <3have they spoken to you about techniques they can use a few days prior to the induction, like cervadil? there's also something called cytoteq that they use to open the cervix, but it won't help soften it like the cervadil will...sex is the best HOME thing I can recommend, to be honest.Stacey had some good ideas as well, but unfortunately NEEDING to be induced doesn't mean your body is READY for labor, so there just may be nothing you can do to soften it on your own and that's OK - a c-section is a better outcome than the alternative of the preeclampsia putting you both in danger for longer...so try not to go into the induction disappointed no matter what the outcome is.BUT I really would talk to them about the prostaglandin gels that they can put into your vagina to artifically soften your cervix a few days before the induction..combine that with the dilation \"balloons\" and stuff like cytoteq, and a careful doctor who is mindful of trying to avoid a c-section will give you the best chance possible to avoid one. most of all try to relax - studies have proven that relaxation does the same thing for your cervix that it does for your rectal sphinctor - it helps to open it!best of luck hon..keep us posted, will you? when is the induction scheduled?",

            "answer": "Its a rough situation you are in and I hope things work out for you because your options are more limited.I honestly cant tell you what would work, I went into early labor two weeks ago and dilated to 3 CM and then stopped dilated... I have tried everything to move the process along and nothing is working, which is hilarious to me since I am already dilated, my baby is super low and engaged, and my cervix is mostly thinned out and extremely soft??\u00a0\u00a0On the bright side, you are just trying to soften your cervix so your induction is more likely to be successful while im trying to push myself into active labor naturally so your job might be easier... unfortunately my regular strong contractions stopped after 3 days.This is what I have learned over the last couple weeks..Sex - probably the best thing so far.. The day I went into active labor, I was not dilated, had no contractions felt fine.. We had sex that evening then I was making dinner and my contractions were coming every 3 mins... Went to the hospital - dilated to 1 CM, then to 3 over the next day.. Of course, I stopped there but even if you could get to that part it would be a great help.\u00a0\u00a0I find sex gives me very consistent intense contractions still but the only issue is that even with doing this several times since that initial night, i dont seem to be progressing despite that at this time so baby must not be ready.\u00a0\u00a0but once again you are just trying to ripen your cervix and sex is great for it..Raspberry Leaf tea- People swear by it, I have been using it over the last little bit and still no luck with it.. What I have learned through research is that the tea does nothing to help early labor but can greatly shorten the pushing stage of labor and it promotes uterine health.. I keep drinking it because whether it puts me in labor or not, the other benefits sound pretty good too..Spicy food - does nothing for me...Pineapple juice is suppose to ripen the cervix... i eat alot of pineapple and my cervix is quite soft so who knows...Reflexology - I had a reflexology massage when things were moving for me.. and it didnt do anything for me but it felt really amazing.. the lady said it wont work for everyone and if your body isnt doing the process naturally then it most likely wont be successful.\u00a0\u00a0She did teach me the spot to rub if you dotn want to spend the money...\u00a0\u00a0So the inside of your ankle represents your reproduction organs..\u00a0\u00a0the puffy spot around that area is your bladder.. if you use 3\u00a0\u00a0fingers and feel up to a spot where you are just below your pointy bone, that is the spot for the uterus...\u00a0\u00a0you should do it on both feet and see which spot is more tight.. She said if something is going on in uterus then you should feel a little crunchy spot where you are suppose to rub....\u00a0\u00a0But if you dont,you can still work it anyways...\u00a0\u00a0Her suggestion was to rub it this way:\u00a0\u00a0use one finger and rub the crunchy spot or general spot 3 times in a round motion then switch back to the 3 fingers and do 3 larger round rubs of the general area on the inside of your ankle....\u00a0\u00a0repeat this 4 times then give yourself a 30 minute break and do it again..Walking - do alot of walking especially if you are having contractions.. if your baby is already pushing against your cervix and is low then walking will put extra pressure on the cervix if you are walking...\u00a0\u00a0I always found my contractions got more intense and regular while walking so it can definitely help to pick things up...the easy part for you any progress even if its minimal will greatly aid your induction so i hope some of these things work for you...\u00a0\u00a0i have thought about starting evening primrose myself but i also feel a bit burnt out from this trying time and am convinced now that i wont progress further until the baby decides its ready....\u00a0\u00a0who knew I would be 39 weeks today when they were concerned i was going ot have the baby by 32 weeks.I hope your inductions takes so you dont have to have the c-section",

My nurse midwife was going to induce me the next day even with my cervix being closed,but that could have irritated the baby and I could have had a c-section. When she kept for a 24 hour hold in the hospital, she found my blood pressure had stayed low. The next day she discharged me\u00a0\u00a0and put me on bed rest until the end of pregnancy. I now have to have an ultrasound done twice a week along with seeing my nurse midwife and have a non-stress test done. Although she is talking about possibly inducing me in the next week or two. I went to my first appointment today and the ultrasound went well, my blood pressure is normal, labs came back well, and non stress test went great.There were two things I had hoped for in labor:1. Have my baby born on my mom's birthday which is next week on Friday the 13th. I think that would be cool for my baby and my mom to share the same birthday.OR2. Go into labor while on the job...Well since I am on bed rest and cannot work I can't do that. I thought it would be fun to have my water break while at work so to everyone I could be like \"SWEET! I finally have an excuse to leave work! Later suckers, I'm gunna go have a baby!\"But anyway. Good luck to you, and hope everything goes well :)",

    "question": "Hello ladies!Here's my story:\u00a0\u00a0I am almost 36 weeks along and have a fairly severe case of preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor is going to induce me at 37 weeks. (As it is safer for both the baby and me to have him out instead of in.)\u00a0\u00a0HOWEVER he is a bit concerned that I have not dilated on my own and that, if we do an induction, since I have not dilated and my cervix is not \"ripe\" that the induction won't work right and I will end up needing a C-section.I have been having regular, intense contractions for three days now.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor said they are the real thing - not Braxton Hicks, but that they're not causing me to ripen or dilate, for some reason.\u00a0\u00a0Also the baby's head is very low.I'm wondering if you know of natural ways to soften the cervix and cause dilation.\u00a0\u00a0I don't need things that bring on contractions, as I am already having those.\u00a0\u00a0I just need to get my cervix soft and ready!\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to be induced if I'm not ready, only to end up needing a C-section.The ways that I have heard so far are sex, nipple stimulation, red raspberry tea and evening primrose oil tablets.\u00a0\u00a0My husband and I have tried all of these.\u00a0\u00a0I just started the raspberry tea and evening primrose oil last night.Do you have any other suggestions?\u00a0\u00a0And know how long they take to normally get the cervix ripe?Thank you so much in advance!!\u00a0\u00a0I know it's not \"normal\" to be wanting/needing to ripen the cervix when you are only 36 weeks along.\u00a0\u00a0But because of my preeclampsia and needing to be induced soon, it is better.Thanks again!",
