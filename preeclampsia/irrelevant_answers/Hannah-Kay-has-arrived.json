The hospital photo just does not do he justice!cinnamonheart, try going to www.altru.org, then there is a tab at the top that says nursery. Then under the girl list you will find Hannah with parents, Kristen and Michael.Hannah is asleep in Daddy's arms so I have a few more minutes to tell you all about what happened. If you remember, I was on bedrest for preeclampsia since March 18th. April 5th, I was going to have an Amniocentesis to test baby's lung maturity, but my BP was high, and my Dr. decided to cancel the Amnio and do a C-section that day. The reason we had a C-section instead of an induction was the baby's presentation was breech. The section went great! I thought the whole experience was amazing. DH watched the entire procedure, he was such a trooper! After Hannah was born, I was put on Magnesium Sulfate for 24 hours due to my BP being high. I had to stay on bedrest for 2 more days. Which was hard. DH changed all baby's diapers and helped me to breastfeed. I was so impressed by his level of involvement. Hannah was born at 34 weeks gestation and she is perfect! She did not need to spend any time in the NICU, and she was able, to room in with DH and I. She is breasfeeding beautifully and rarely even cries. She is such a good baby! I never understood how much I could love another person until I had her. I'm so emotional and happy, I cry so easily. DH and I have waited so long for this day to arrive. Thank you everyone for all your support through my having a miscarriage, then struggling with infertility, and then worrying constantly about this pregnancy. I just want everyone to know who is having troube getting pregnant, if I can do this, so can you!!I am still on some BP meds because I am continueing to have high pressures. Hopefully things will get better and I can taper them off in the next few weeks. I feel good, my incision barely hurts anymore. Hannah has her first Dr appt with tomorrow, and I have one on Weds. We'll keep you updated on our progress and hopefully I will be able to stay caught up on what is going on with everyone now that I have this little bundle to love!",

I have red curly hair, and I've been hoping she would have red hair like me. I have this vision in my mind of a little mini me running around with red hair and freckles. It will be interesting to see in the next few months or years how she changes. I can't wait! But at the same time I want her to stay little too. She is a about 5 lbs now and is just a little dolly.
