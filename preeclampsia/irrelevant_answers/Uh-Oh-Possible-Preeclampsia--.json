I never even really thought about getting preclampsia. I read about it but haven't really looked into it too much. I have my first internal appointment this afternoon. Not looking forward to getting probed.Glad to hear that your little one is doing great. That's the important part I guess...getting these little babies out safely.Keep us posted.",

I have been a little swollen on my hands and feet and a little round in the face...hmm..and I have been gaining like 3 pounds a week??? Maybe I should check my bp. My mom had pre-eclampsya with both of her pregnancies so I should probably be aware of it.I know how you feel about the not being dialated. I am frustrated. I have started walking and I might start letting my husband touch me again..haha!..I am just sooo miserable.",

I have not gained too much in my face but it feels puffier lately - and I asked my DR yesterday about this and they did not seem concerned at all. It sounds like a number of us are like this? I am hoping it is not pre-ec. an dI am NOT even going to google it - or I will convince myself I have it too.But just remember - you are 38 wks with a healthy and amazing baby girl - so as long as she gets out healthy - that is all that matters.Did anyone see Grays Anatomy last night with the baby they delivered?? Or Private Practice after? I swear - they need a disclaimer with these shows \"do not watch if you are expecting\"Keep us posted on the test results!",

Yeah, don't google pre-eclampsia... I really regret that I did!\u00a0\u00a0:)BTW... I have left 2 messages for the nurse to call me with the results and I haven't heard a thing.\u00a0\u00a0It is 4:30pm AZ time right now.\u00a0\u00a0They are the WORST with calling back... I made the mistake of forgetting to ask my doctor when I would hear the results, so now I just have to play the guessing game.\u00a0\u00a0UGHHHH!!",

            "answer": "I had pre-elampsia, formerly called toxemia of pregnancy with my first child.\u00a0\u00a0I had it so badly, that I was hospitalized for 8 days in my 9th month.\u00a0\u00a0I was actually put on Lasix (fluid) pills during my last weeks of pregnancy to help with the water weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0Mind you, this is a pregnancy that was long ago....38 years.If any of you have read about pre-eclampsia, it can get dangerous very quickly....I'll be honest.\u00a0\u00a0This is the reason you should be on the look out for any sudden headaches, sudden swelling in the feet, ankles, face and hands.\u00a0\u00a0If you have a blood pressure kit at home, use it.\u00a0\u00a0Your blood pressures taken at home would be more accurate, because you don't have that nervousness about being in the doctor's office.\u00a0\u00a0I call it \"white-coat hypertension\" when you show higher levels at the doctor's office.Pre-eclampsia can come on very suddenly and happen at any time during the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0It almost always will occur with the first pregnancy, if it is going to happen at all.\u00a0\u00a0This is NOT to say that every women having her first child will develop it.\u00a0\u00a0So please don't be scared.It is believed that this high blood pressure situation has to do with the placenta.\u00a0\u00a0Delivery of the baby is the only way to cure it.\u00a0\u00a0If it is too high, before you are ready to deliver, some doctor's will put you in the hospital on bed rest, always laying on your side, with an IV of Magnesium Sulfate.\u00a0\u00a0This medication tends to keep your blood pressure readings down (it also is used to prevent pre-mature labor) and may prevent one of the complications of pre-eclampsia, which is seizures or stroke.\u00a0\u00a0It's not a disorder you want to play around with.\u00a0\u00a0It is serious.Better to call your doctor if you are noticing any sudden swelling and not assume that swelling is normal for all pregnant women.Doctor's are really on top of things like this, so follow your doctor's orders to the letter.\u00a0\u00a0No doctor will risk harming you or the baby.\u00a0\u00a0They have many avenues to access to help prevent this from going into full blown eclampsia.Listen to your bodies and listen to your doctor's.....Best Wishes and here's to healthy, happy mother's and baby's.HeatherFrom the MS Forum",

    "question": "So, I just came home from my 38 week appt. and we were given mixed news.\u00a0\u00a0Here is what happened...For the past few days-week, I have been more swollen than usual.\u00a0\u00a0My feet look like sausages, my hands hurt from being swollen, and my face is looking a bit more round.\u00a0\u00a0I figured this was all part of being pregnant, so I didn't call my doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Well, when I got on the scale today I had gained 5 1/2 lbs. in a week in a half.\u00a0\u00a0So, this was the first red flag.\u00a0\u00a0Then, my blood pressure was high (I have low blood pressure... not normal,... low, so this was strange).\u00a0\u00a0So, the nurse had me lay down on my left side and rechecked it 15 minutes later.\u00a0\u00a0This time, it came back OK.\u00a0\u00a0But, our doctor is concerned with my swelling, that one blood pressure reading, and the fact that I am all of a sudden sweating like its my job!\u00a0\u00a0So, for the first time, we discussed a possible emergency c-section.\u00a0\u00a0They drew blood to test for preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0I am sort of nervous now... I never thought of something like this happening.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway... I am waiting for the blood results.Good news... Leighton is doing just fine in there :)\u00a0\u00a0Happy as a clam.\u00a0\u00a0So happy in fact, that I am NOT dilated!\u00a0\u00a0I think I am going to be preggers forever.",
