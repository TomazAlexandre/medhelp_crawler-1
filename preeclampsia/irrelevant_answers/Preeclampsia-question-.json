            "answer": "It depends on how high your blood pressure is. If you're in the severe range then you need to see a doctor immediately. Call and tell an OB and they will fit you in. My blood pressure has been up to 142/86 since 20 weeks and they're just paying close attention when I go for my visits. What is your blood pressure and symptoms? Also of you're having severe headaches and blurred vision I would go get checked out. If you suspect pre eclampsia a doctor will fit you in. Being only 23 weeks though it's unlikely that you'll need to go to the ER, though definitely not impossible. If it is severe they will put you on hospital bed rest and magnesium to try to prevent stroke and seizures.",

    "question": "I haven't been diagnosed with it, but I show many symptoms. I'm not able to see an OB right away, due to moving and being in a new place. I have to set up a new doctor. I'm 23 weeks though. My question is....am I okay to wait a couple weeks to see a doc or is this an ER type of situation?? My understanding is that there really isn't anything they can do for preeclampsia except for possibly early delivery. Is that true?? Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!",
