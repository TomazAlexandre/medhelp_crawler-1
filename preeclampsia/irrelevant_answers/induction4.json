    "question": "So tomorrow night I'm getting cytotec or whatever that pill is called inserted vaginally to soften my cervix then Tuesday morning they are going to start the pitocin drip on me to induce me bc I have pre eclampsia. I'll be 37 weeks tomorrow. I'm not dilated at all..Has anyone else been induced this way?The doctor said it would probably be a lengthy procedure since I'm not dilated or anything yet n this is my first baby..how were your experiences?",
