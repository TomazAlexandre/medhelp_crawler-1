    "question": "How would you feel or want to do if......I was diagnosed with Gestational hypertension at 28 weeks and have been on 3 different types of meds and doses to control it nothing keeps it down for long. The farther I get the greater the chances of it becoming preeclampsia. So my dr was just trying to get me to 37 weeks before anything happens and now that I'm almost 37 weeks she wants to keep going until something does happen. I honestly don't want to wait until something happens because I for one don't want to loose my baby or die and leave my children without a mommy. I feel the risk are to much to keep going and he's considered full term Thursday and know he should be just fine. What would you mommy's do? I am scared to death of going until something happens to me/us. I am a nervous mess.",
