            "answer": "Goof luck for tomorrow! This is my second time with it too. Unfortunately, for me it has nothing to do with diet or exercise, I just don't grow very good placentas. I had it severely with my first, developed it at 28wks but managed to get to 35wks, this time ive been battling it since 15wks and hoping to last til my csection at 36wks, currently 33wks but had 5 hospital admissions so far. I hope they can manage the symptoms for you and get you and baby a bit further along. Take care!",

    "question": "I had extreme preeclampsia with my daughter 6 years ago, so I took precaution on this pregnancy. I was watching my diet and trying to take it easy. But yet it seems the condition had not eluded me. I thought it wouldn't be quite so scary this time, since I knew more about it, but I was wrong. I'm not sure if it is because it was caught so much earlier since we were watching for it, I'm only 31 1/2 weeks, or what. Today I did the 24 hr urine test and tomorrow we'll get the results and then we go from there. Other than the preeclampsia, baby and I are doing great, which is why I'm hoping for the best tomorrow.",
