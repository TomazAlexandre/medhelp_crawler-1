My bp was fine throughout my whole pregnancy up until the last couple of weeks. My bp was really high like 166 high. I had the choice of inducing or csection but my lil girl was in distress and probably would of had to have a csection anyway. She was born 4 weeks and 2 days premature perfectly healthy",

They wouldn't let me push my son out. I was at risk for stroking since my bp was so high and pushing him out was not an option.",

    "question": "Hey mommies :) had an appointment today at 31 weeks, and my doctor said I have had a spike in my blood pressure and that this is a sign of preeclampsia .. My BP has been regular and pretty much the same all the way through but now it's changed.. I do have frequent headaches and the last two weeks i have been feeling unwell a lot, not sleeping well, but no swelling.. My doctor says I may need inducing if my BP continues to rise. Anyone had this experience? I really don't know what preeclampsia is or anything.. Thanks in advance! Xx",
