Ihave not had to do urone collection as when it spikes they make me come back the following 2days for checks and urine samples. If it os still high this week at my 36w5d\u00a0\u00a0appt while on the meds i think they will probably put me on full bed rest until i deliver.",

So my Dr did blood work to do a different kidney and liver function test. Which I will know the results tomorrow. But in the mean time she diagnosed me with gestational hypertension and put me on blood pressure meds.",

    "question": "I'm a ftm and 35 weeks along. I have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes which I have been able to control with my diet alone, thankfully.Yesterday I had an appointment and my blood pressure was high (143/80) at the beginning of the appointment. My doctor took my blood pressure again at the end of the appointment because I've never had a high blood pressure reading before and it was 130/93, so still high. Today I'm doing a 24 hour urine test to make sure my kidneys and liver are functioning properly.Has anyone else had this situation? I'm worried about having preeclampsia along with gestational diabetes. I just want the rest of the pregnancy to go smoothly and our little girl to come out healthy and strong.",
