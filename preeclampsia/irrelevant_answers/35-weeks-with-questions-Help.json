I was hospitalized twice for two false alarms, I had wicked Braxton hicks contractions with my second that sent me to the hospital twice! And this was my second baby, after ten years, you'd still think I could tell the difference. I was embarrassed but my doctor said it is always better to err on the side of caution, and it is always better to call that's what they are getting paid for....goodluck! Don't want to scare you but\u00a0\u00a0Looking back the real contractions are very very intense and they come on slowly and then intensify and\u00a0\u00a0peak then subside....they feel like INTENSE\u00a0\u00a0burning/ ripping in lower abdominal area and back, they wrap around more like a very severe menstrual cramp....you can't move or talk....they are painful but we all survive, and that baby isso worth it good\u00a0\u00a0luck!!!!!not mild...and it's hard to talk",

But then I'd have a 10 minute stretch where I didn't have any. And then another 10 minute stretch where they were 1 minute apart. They checked me and I had dilated a LITTLE (just to a 1.\u00a0\u00a0But yesterday at the doctor's I wasn't dilated at all.). But when she checked me again in an hour, my dilation hadn't changed, so they told me to come home.\u00a0\u00a0She actually told me that if I had dilated more - even to a two, then they would have kept me there!\u00a0\u00a0Also, she could feel the baby's head!!\u00a0\u00a0SO exciting!!",

            "answer": "Technically, Braxton-Hicks do not cause dilation so what you are having are real...if they get stronger, get regular, etc call your doc :)When I had my son (my second child) I was having what I thought were Braxton-Hicks contractions. I was up and walking. When a contraction came, I would stop and wait it out. They were abdominal (usually real contractions originate in the back and come around to the front...Braxton_Hicks start in front and move around to the back). As it happens, they were real contractions...I got in bed, my water broke and he was born 41 minutes later.With my daughter (child #1) I knew immediately the contractions were real. I napped during the first 7 or 8 hours (yeah...I am laid back LOL...who at age 20 naps knowing they are in labor?).Every pregnancy and every labor is different. With this one, I've had a mix of Braxton-Hicks and serious contractions...but they don't get regular and so far no cervical changes. My mother tended to have loooooong labors and took forever to dilate....until she got to a certain point the then WHAM! Baby came quick.Best wishes for you...and welcome to the over 35 forum :)",

            "answer": "Yep...one of my most memorable moment in delivering my daughter: her dad (my husband at the time) had just gotten off a long night shift at the hospital so brought his breakfast into my room (I didnt want to be alone). He put ketchup on his eggs, which grosses me out on a good day. I vomited into his lap LOL (the man has a strong stomach...he saw it coming, moved his plate out of the way...then left the room to clean up and finish his meal ROFL).So yes, nausea is often a symptom that you are in labor.Track your contractions. When they are 5 minutes from the start of one to the start of the next, it is generally time to head to the hospital.I don't like what the nurse said to you (\"if they are so bad you can't talk, you can't walk and they take your breath away.) If I had waited until my contractions were that bad my kids would have been born on the way to the hospital LOL True I have a pretty good pain threshold...but I walked and talked etc until 41 minutes before my son was born :) (no pain meds, no epidural 8 lb 4 oz baby...thankfully was already at the hospital when water broke)Best wishes for you!!",

    "question": "Ladies, I would REALLY love and appreciate your help and advice.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 35 weeks, 1 day. I've had complications my entire pregnancy (we went through IVF to get this baby).\u00a0\u00a0I've been on \"modified bed rest\" since 20 weeks because of some heart complications.\u00a0\u00a0But I've been diagnosed with preeclampsia and moved to strict bed rest (and having my blood pressure monitored in labor and delivery every 3 days) for 4 weeks now.\u00a0\u00a0It's actually quite amazing that I've made it this far because two weeks ago, they were thinking they were going to need to take the baby immediately.(I should also mention that I have been posting in the 18-34 boards since I'm technically just shy of turning 33.\u00a0\u00a0However, I feel that all the posts over there are \"Help, I'm 16 could I be pregnant!\" And I never really get the answers or help that I'm looking for.\u00a0\u00a0So I'm going to attempt to post here too.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you don't mind!)Yesterday at my doctor's appointment, he told me we're finally \"good to go\" if I happen to go into labor on my own.\u00a0\u00a0And if the baby isn't here by 37 weeks, he'll induce me.\u00a0\u00a0He also told me at my appointment that I haven't dilated, but his exact words, as he checked me were \"WOW.\u00a0\u00a0This baby's head is REAAAAALY low!\"Last night, I was having horrible back pains - some of the worst I've ever had.\u00a0\u00a0This morning, I woke up at 5:00 am and the back pain is relieved, however, I am having very painful menstrual-type cramps.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't had menstrual type cramps throughout my entire pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0If I go lay or sit in bed, they're worse.\u00a0\u00a0(This mght sound SUPER weird - but the only thing that makes them feel better is sitting on the toilet.)\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what to do.\u00a0\u00a0I don't particulary want to go into L&D since I'll be in there on Friday to have my BP monitored.\u00a0\u00a0Just wondering what might be going on and thought you ladies might be able to guide/direct me and help.",
