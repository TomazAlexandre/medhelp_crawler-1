            "answer": "Congrats on 18 weeks!! I can't believe how quick time is going!!I'm sorry that your little one is causing you worry, my son did the same thing to me. I had an anterior placenta which blocked me from feeling a lot of his movements, do you think that this maybe the case with you? It would also make sense to me that the scar tissue might be blocking some of those movements as well, especially since our little ones aren't that strong yet. I would definitely bring it up at the next appointment to help you feel better, but my Dr. always told me as long as your not experiencing significantly less movement (in the same pregnancy) that there is nothing to worry about, like children our little peanuts all have different activity levels too.As far as the heart beat being really low, if the Dr. wasn't concerned I would try not to worry yourself. Its all about positioning, and they flip around ALL OVER lol! I have a home doppler and find my baby in different spots all the time, some times really low.If you are feeling any pressure though, make sure you do ask your Dr. about this. Although I think its also pretty normal while having a bowel movement... I know when I have to \"go\" sometimes I even feel some pinching and tension on my stitch (I have a cerclage).Hang in there girly your doing great!! Its only natural to worry, that's what us Momma's do! Almost half way there!!! Have you found out what your having yet??",

            "answer": "I also think it could be partly because of your c-section.\u00a0\u00a0I'm pregnant with my first now, so haven't ever had one, but I've had a few surgeries, and I know for several months after the surgery the area around my scar was almost numb since the nerves had to heal. It was an area of about 2 inches around the scar that was numb.\u00a0\u00a0A c-section is a much larger incision than the ones I had, so I can see it impacting feeling.\u00a0\u00a0The baby could just be more laid back than your first as well!",

My two will be 15 1/2mo apart (possibly even 15 mo apart if this pregnancy follows the path of the first) and i had a csection with my first.With my first son I had an anterior placenta so I didn't feel kicks til about 23w in and this time I felt them at 18w and by 20w I was feeling movement most days.I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. by the way, expect to feel some stretching/burning around your incision area as it stretches. That happened to me for about a week.",

    "question": "Okay, here is my concern. Most of you know I gave birth to a beautiful little girl Sarah this past February. I am pregnant again, 18 weeks, and due again this coming February. I felt Sarah kick roughly around the 16 week mark...and she was an active one....by 18 weeks she was constantly kicking and making me uncomfortable bc that is all she does. At 18 weeks in this pregnancy I feel maybe a kick once every couple days...and thats it! This concerns me a bit. I am wondering if maybe it is because of scar tissue since I had to have a cesarean with sarah? But Im not really sure. Also, what concerns me, is at my 16 week appt, when the midwife was looking for the babys heartbeat, she started looking between my belly button and pubic bone.........but she ended up finding it all the way down on my pubic bone.....still really low. I am wondering if at 16 weeks that is normal?? I have been crampy on and off, and I know TMI< but when I have a bowel movement, I almost feel pressure in my vaginal area?Do you ladies think I should be concerned. My pregnancy with Sarah was good up until 33 weeks when I was in preterm labor and put on bedrest. Then at 38 weeks due to hypertension and mild preeclampsia I was induced only to labor for 12 hours with no progression past 4 cm, and her reactive strip starting to not look so good. So its not like I had any complications early on....but I am just feeling off I guess.Any opinions or advice??? I am just curious.....Thanks ladies.Steph",
