You'll most likely breeze right through the week and your doctor will be back just in time. :) positive vibes!And thanks, Schmalzy! I was.actually gunna message you to see how you're doing! We're getting so close. :) I'm sorry about all of your symptoms, those blow! Don't they seem to happen overnight?! I swear once they start coming, they keep coming with a vengeance lol. You're a trooper, I never had much back pain or sciatica issues. My girlfriend sent me a lower back and belly support brace that helps with a combo of things, those included I think. Maybe you could look at getting one of those? Keep me posted! \u2764 glad everything else is going well!",

    "question": "Just want to update you lovely ladies that have been with me on this journey. I am 38 weeks tomorrow and am doing mediocre health wise, but feeling better than I did in week 37. I was at the doctors every day and in and out of L&D all weekend due to being at risk for preeclampsia and gestational hypertension. High blood pressure, vision changes, severe weight gain, and horrible horrible headaches. Still experiencing all of these symptoms but they are more \"controlled\" as of now. There was a high chance of having to induce me early and luckily my body pushed through that and I get to keep little Mama in there until D-Day! Still feeling overall ill, but in better shape. Feeling optimistic and in control. Dilated 1cm but no where near labor and that's perfectly OK with me. Have an induction date scheduled for 7:30 pm on the 20th with her arrival probably happening on D-Day, the 21st. God is good. :)How are you ladies feeling??",
