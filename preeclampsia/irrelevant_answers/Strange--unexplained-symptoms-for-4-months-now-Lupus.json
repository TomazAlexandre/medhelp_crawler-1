            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Apart from disc problems in the back and anxiety and panic attacks, muscle spasms can be due to several causes. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, muscle fatigue, pinched nerve due to wrong posture could be the cause in your case.Drink plenty of water, eat healthy, take a multivitamin supplement and see if the symptoms improve. Also, please take up yoga.You must also ask your doctor to run the following tests: parathyroid hormone, repeat vitamin D, calcium, phosphate, uric acid, potassium, creatinine phosphokinase and liver function tests.Sleep at regular times (try since the baby is now big). Since waning the baby off mother\u2019s milk can cause post partum depression in mother, this aspect should also be looked into by your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hello!\u00a0\u00a0I'll try to make this very long story as short as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Please read it all if you would, as I'm desperate for answers.\u00a0\u00a0I hope someone can help me.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a Caucasian female, 29 years old, and recently had a baby 10 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0Shortly after I had to wean him unexpectedly, my hormones caused my normally controlled anxiety to skyrocket and that's when all my symptoms started, in case that's relevant to anyone.It started with my right leg feeling kinda stiff and sore like I'd done a good workout just on that leg, but I hadn't done anything.\u00a0\u00a0I had cleaned our very large shower the day before and likely bore a lot of my weight on my leg in the process, so I attributed it to that.\u00a0\u00a0It lasted a week, which I thought was a little long, but it went away so I let it go.Just as my leg started to feel better, I began to have the EXACT same feeling in my right arm, from my shoulder blade and down my tricep.\u00a0\u00a0I had just been holding my very wiggly then-6-month-old baby in an odd position and chocked it up to that.\u00a0\u00a0I figured I must just be wildly out of shape for my muscles to be acting like this.\u00a0\u00a0I went on bedrest in my 3rd trimester for hypertension (turned into preeclampsia at the end) and then when my son was born, he WOULD NOT nap during the day unless I was holding him for the first 4 months of his life, so I was pretty much confined to the couch a lot of the time.\u00a0\u00a0So yeah, I figured I was just out of shape.Well about week into my shoulder blade/arm hurting, my upper back seized up and got SUUUPER tight.\u00a0\u00a0Saw a massage therapist who thought maybe a subtle injury had caused my muscled to tighten to protect my joints (?).\u00a0\u00a0It felt better if I stood up very straight, but I'd been so used to slouching with my little one that I couldn't maintain a perfect posture very long (out of habit).Two to three weeks after that, my arm was still not better and I had pain in a very specific spot under my shoulder blade.\u00a0\u00a0All of a sudden, my forearm (all the muscle on top, not on the bottom) got crazy tight, where I could actually see the muscle tone in my arm without flexing.\u00a0\u00a0It wasn't spasming or anything, it was just in a perpetual state of tightness.That was enough for me.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my internist who was a little baffled, said Lyme was possibility or maybe even MS or Lupus, but that we should try PT first to see if it helped.(FYI: the lyme bloodwork at that time came back negative, but about 3 days before this started, I had a very strange bugbite that left a horrible purplish-red raised bruised that faded from the inside, making it look like a ring before it disappeared.\u00a0\u00a0All CBC, vitamin/mineral levels came back normal except for a mildly low Vitamin D, I think around 30, which many doctors say is low normal but there's room for improvement.)3 months of PT and my right arm was 98% better, but would still experience the cramping symptoms in my forearm and my right hand when doing repetitive or fine motor tasks (i.e. writing, cooking/stirring, etc).\u00a0\u00a0My therapist was convinced my symptoms were musculo-skeletal and that in time it would subside.Well I'm still having vague symptoms in my right forearm and hand, but not a similar pain has appeared in my LEFT arm for seemingly no reason.\u00a0\u00a0Last week both my hands felt crampy and like I had to crack my knuckles but they wouldn't crack.\u00a0\u00a0No swelling of the joints, just crampy feeling.Then my left forearm felt easily fatigued and crampy.\u00a0\u00a0Now that's gone, but this week a sharper tendonitis-type pain surfaced from my wrist down into my inner elbow (until now, it's always been more of an achy muscle pain).\u00a0\u00a0That lasted a day, then the same pain moved into the crease of my elbow and low bicep and that's still there.Also, I was leaning on my left foot in the shower one night (not for long as far as I remember) and between my ankle and heel began to ache and that lasted 3 days.\u00a0\u00a0Now if I'm on my feet for not very long at all, they get achy.\u00a0\u00a0I've had that when I'm on my feet all day, but this happens after only an hour or so.And lastly, a couple years ago I developed Raynaud's, where my finger tips and toes will turn white to the first knuckle when I get really cold and then a deep red or purple when I warm back up.\u00a0\u00a0If I'm cold for too long, they actually start to hurt a lot.\u00a0\u00a0I also at the same time noticed what I thought was hormonal skin changed on my face (forehead and either side of my nose).\u00a0\u00a0I had a patch of scaly reddish skin under my left cheek bone that went away when I got pregnant but looks like it's trying to come back, and what I thought were some pinkish-red inflamed pores on either side of my nose is starting to scare me about a possible butterfly rash forming (I don't think it's on my nose though).\u00a0\u00a0Though this has been there for a couple years, back when I had no other symptoms at all and started to come back when my hormones went berserk but also when all these other symptoms appeared.So it seems I'm having many migratory symptoms and it's baffling to me and my family.\u00a0\u00a0I have another dr. appt on Monday to go over all the new details with her, but before then I was hoping someone might be able to clue me into something.\u00a0\u00a0Opinions on what it could be, questions I should ask my doctor, tests I should run, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Do these symptoms fall in line with Lupus or other autoimmunes?Any help is greatly appreciated!",
