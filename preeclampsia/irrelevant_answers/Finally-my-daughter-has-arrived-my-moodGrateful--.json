    "question": "It has been a long and tough journey for me but God has and still is helping through it.I had my daughter at 36 weeks on July 21,2015.I did not find out until birth that she was a girl because she would never show anything she's been very modest,my husband says that she will be just find if she continues how she's started,meaning not showing anything ha ha so funny but oh so true.She's still at the hospital since she was early and I am so ready to have my little spicy princess with us but it will happen in due time.One thing I do want to mention is preeclampsia the high blood pressure problem that happens in pregnancy.After months of me reading about it it happened suddenly to me on the day before I gave birth,I was on an appointment and they checked my pressure and saw that my baby was less active and under weight for 36 weeks she was being affected by it so now Im taking high blood pressure medication and was told that it could last up to six weeks after birth sooooooo ladies if any swelling,pain,decreased fetal movement (do not wait)to go and check on your baby.She's doing wonderful now and through it all I give my God thanks for a smooth and quick labour and delivery experience.May the lord also be there for you all as he has and is there for my family and I.Well I guess that's all,for months I've enjoyed this app and it's been fun.last time signing over and out Cutelittlefinger.God bless .",
