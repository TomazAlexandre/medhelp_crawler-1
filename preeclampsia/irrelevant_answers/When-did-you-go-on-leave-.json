            "answer": "You need to think about you and your family. If you can work things out with your job and school than take advantage of that. You can only do as much as your body will let you. Everyone is different... Some work until hours before delivery. But you don't want to risk complications if you can do something to prevent it. No body will think you are weak or any less of a person for thinking ahead and doing what's best for your baby. You just be the best mom you can be and don't stress (as much as you can avoid it).",

    "question": "Ok, ladies, my body is screaming for me to rest. I am currently 31 weeks with #3 and working, going to summer classes and caring for 2 children as a single parent. I cannot even clean my house due to weakness, exhaustion, and nausea. I took a shower at 1 pm and had to lye down afterwards because I became light headed, wobbly, and weak (had there been another adult here, I would have asked for help to my bed). I have history of eclampsia and hellp syndrome and was induced at 32 weeks with my first, then induced at 37 weeks due to preeclampsia with my second. My BP and protein have been good this time so far, although I have pica and muscle cramps. At work I feel like I want to lye on the cold floor.... I'm not sure what to do. If I quit my classes and go on leave there will be small consequences, but I have a good track record and I'm respected and the issues could be pretty easily solved to straighten out my work and school situations after I have recovered...I just haven't reached my goals for the year yet....which would be completed on July 31, but I'm due only 9 days later.",
