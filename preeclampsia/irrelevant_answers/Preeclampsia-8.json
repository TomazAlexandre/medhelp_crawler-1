    "question": "I have been experiencing really bad swelling in my feet and legs but the Dr said as long as my blood pressure was normal it's not dangerous. Well at today's Dr app my blood pressure was 147/93. So she ordered a 24hr urine collection for protein detection. Has anyone else had to do this?",
