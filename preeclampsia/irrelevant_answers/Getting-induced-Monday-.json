            "answer": "I was induced for the same reason and all went really well. First of they started with softening my cervix on the first day, then on 2nd day more medicines up my cervix to get it more ready and the next day midwife broke my waters and took me to delivery room at 9am. They put me on the drip and at 4pm I was in proper labour. My baby arrived just before 8pm after an hour of pushing.If I could give you any tips it would be:- be patient coz all of the stages with softening the cervix take time- use that time to rest and relax coz everything is under control, you are in the hospital already being looked after the staff- don't stress yourself, the happier you will be the easier it will be- if you can't cope with pain ask for pain relief",

            "answer": "Yup I was induced with first at 39+5 and ended in csection. And y is it just suspected y are they not sure? Do you have protein in your urine,high bp, swelling, bad headaches? If they v are not sure that's dumb to induce you. There is a very simple blood test( which I had done today) to check for sure. Not all inductions end in cesarean but does increase the chance.",

Anyway, I'm scared, I've heard it usually ends in c-section and complications. How do they induce you?\u00a0\u00a0What does it feel like?\u00a0\u00a0How long does it take?\u00a0\u00a0Anyone who's been induced, can you shed some light for me so I kinda know what to expect :) thanks",
