            "answer": "I had low blood pressure with my first and before we could leave the hospital it became very high and stayed that way for 6 months and then went back to normal, then with my second it got high around 6 months and I started getting trace amounts of protein in my urine so they put me on a blood pressure medicine and we made it to 39 weeks for our scheduled c-section without pre-eclampsia. Now I'm 16 weeks 6 days with #3 and it's getting higher slowly and I've got trace amounts of protein in my urine again. Good luck I hope you don't get it and try not to stress it raises your blood pressure, did they put you on a blood pressure medicine to lower it?",

    "question": "Has anyone had this and not had high bp before pregnancy? Everytime I get checked, it's higher. My swelling is bad. There is no protein in my urine so no preeclampsia yet. I've been put out of work. What happened with you? Did they just monitor it until baby came? Did they have to induce you? Did you make it full term? Any other complications resulting from it? And how common is it for pre-e to develop later on? Sorry.. I'm a worried ftm! I'm 31 weeks",
