            "answer": "I was a couple days overdue and doctors said babygirl was 10lbs so they induced me. I was fine the night I was admitted but the next day they started pitocin. The drip they had me on wasnt working so they decided to up the drip. Well they upped it too much and my contractions were unbareable. So once again they changed the drip to a slower speed. I refused any meds so it was painful but it was all worth it. I had a beautiful 8lb baby after 13 hrs. :) good luck hun im sure youll do great",

            "answer": "Went in for induction sunday since I was only 50% effaced and half centimeter dilated. Well they gave me a pill to take every 4 hours to help soften cervix. I started first one and didnt notice anything until end of the 4th hour I began to feel small contractions. Then walked a bit took another pill and contractions picked up and came more often... well I was on monitors the whole time an baby was fine then suddenly her heart rate dropped to 50 and nurses an doctor came running in and called a code C ended up with an emergency c section and had to be put under for my safety and babies. They dont know what caused it or why it happened.",

I was annoyed because I hadn't eaten and they wouldn't let me eat. I opted for the epidural, but wish I hadn't now. Try really hard not to give into the pain, because I couldn't push my daughter out properly because I couldn't feel the contractions or my hips. I had my daughter at 6:33am the next morning after they had to use a device to help pull her out.",

I opted for the epidural but it didn't work one bit, so I felt everything! It got real bad at 6-7cm. I went from 7cm to the birth of my son in an hour and 10 minutes!! I dilated from 7 to a 9.5 in about 25 minutes!! At 9cm my contractions were to the point where my body started to automatically push and I couldn't help it but to push! They let me start pushing with the nurse at 9.5 cm while the Dr got prepared. Once Dr was set it took 4 big pushes and he was out! I won't sugar coat it when I say it was and will ever be the worst pain of my life, but the power and accomplishment you feel when you don't have pain meds is incredible. Its worth it and deep down I'm so thankful my epidural didn't work! Good luck to you momma:)",

I was then put on oxygen mask and pitocin was stopped since her heart was was dipping again and they were unsure of the cause. Midwife was called to help insert a monitor to see why baby girls heart rate was fluctuating. Midwife showed up at 1250 checked my progress and I was already dilated to 9 without the continuation of pitocin by 1 they wanted to try a practice push to see how it would go and by 1:17 pm she was born. 10 minutes of pushing and just about 4 hours of active labor",
