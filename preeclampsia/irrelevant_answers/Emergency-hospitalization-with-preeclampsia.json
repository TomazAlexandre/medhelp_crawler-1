They could possibly keep me until next week and do baby brain scan to see the development.But baby hasnt really grown much for the past few weeks. So thats the reason they want her out. Still hoping for a miracle though..",

Also, she started opening her eyes and looking around a few days ago. I also had several opportunities to hold her on my chest. Of course, there are issues that come up here and there.. But, thank God, so far its mainly something that van be treated or should fix itself when she grows a bit.Thank you again. She is my little angel and Im very grateful to have her in my life.Just want to say to all mamas to be: take it easy, listen to your body, if something bothers you call your doctor right away. You are entering the final stretch!! Wishing you all an easy timely delivery and healthy babies!!",

    "question": "Laying in hospital bed now... Need to let it out..(Sorry for long post).Im 28 weeks. Went for my regular doctor's checkup today. So far my pregnancy has been going very well so what happened today just put me in shock.First, my blood pressure was 140/80. Then doctor did US and said baby measured small. She immediately sent me to the hospital for additional checks and monitoring. I was still hoping that everything would be fine.Got to the hospital, they put me in hospital gown, checked BP. It was 180/110 at that point. Next thing, bunch of doctors/nurses, 2 shots for lowering BP and 1 steroid shot for baby's lungs. BP still stayed high, got hooked up to IV with magnesium and started talking emergency C-section if BP doesnt go down.. My baby's only 1lb7oz though..So now, Ive been at the hospital for 13 hours, exhausted, worried, hungry (havent eaten for 16 hours)..Thank God my BP went down. Im still hooked up to magnesium though. Im scared that even if my BP stays low, I might have to do c-section for a 28 week baby who already measures small. They say that one you have this desease, it only gets worse..Also have high protein (3.2) in my blood which is one of the symptoms. My blood tests for other symptoms all came back fine though. Thank God!!Its 1am now, gonna try to sleep. Please pray for me and my little girl. If you have any preeclampsia stories, Id love to hear!!",
