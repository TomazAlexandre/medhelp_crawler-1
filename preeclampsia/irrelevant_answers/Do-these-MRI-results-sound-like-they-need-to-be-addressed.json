            "answer": "Hi,How are you?Your MRI findings are non specific but since in MS also the findings are somewhat similar it cannot be excluded.Also your symptoms are non specific. One incident of floaties is not very significant. Your symptoms can be due to fatigue or also nerve compression.Yes it will be a good idea to consult a neurologist. Do let me know if you need more information and do keep us posted!",

            "answer": "Thanks so much. I am somewhat relieved by your comment. I know I should see a Dr. regarding this and I will. Fatigue I am sure since I was 8 mos. pregnant. It has not happened since. I was told that white matter is never a good sign so I will look into this further.Do you think medically this impression can be anything else?Thanks again,Katie",

    "question": "\"There are a few small punctate regions of increased white matter signal on flair imaging into the Periventricular white matter bilaterally in the frontal and parietal lobes. This is a non-specific finding but can occasionally be seen in cases of demyelination. An easrly demyelinating process. (MS can not be excluded)\"Sorry for being so wordy! I am very worried. I don't have a primary doctor. Should I just try to find a neuro instead and bring the MRI?I do have pain, sometimes very painful, in my feet..And little sensation to the touch in my right leg from the knee down. I awake in the middle of the night and my hand is completely numb and burning.Lastly, when I was 8 mos. pregnant I had preeclampsia and encountered one occasion of \"floaties\" in both eyes...Thats what prompted the MRI above to rule out an aneurysm.Thanks so much for your advice...Katie",
