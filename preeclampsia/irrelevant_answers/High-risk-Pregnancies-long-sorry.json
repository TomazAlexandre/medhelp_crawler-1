            "answer": "I'm a high risk momma 34 weeks with my second son. I have Marfan syndrome which affects all the connective tissue in my body and puts me at risk of an aortic tear during labor. I had to deliver in the cardiac ICU with my first and will be doing the same with this one. I can't push while birthing and a c-section is possibly to strenuous for my heart so I HAVE to have an epidural and they will deliver baby via vacuum/forceps. There is a 50/50 chance my kids will have it too. It's scary but worth all the extra precautions. I wish things could be different but I know that I'm also helping new doctors to learn about my syndrome. I feel a bit like I'm part of a freak show when in hospital but I know its not a common situation thus making everyone curious. Hang in there you can do this, we are so lucky to have the medical technology we do now.",

    "question": "Hi mommies, I was wondering if there are other high-risk pregnancies out there?\u00a0\u00a0Im 21, 10w+5, and high-risk. I have a rare genetic disorder called tuberous sclerosis which causes tumors to grow on vital organs, seIzures, and behavioral issues. I myself only have a mild case with tumors in my brain (not dangerous yet.been stable for 11yrs) and tumors and cyst cover my kidneys. Im high risk because it puts me at risk for preeclampsia, premature labor, and the possibility of losing a kidney. There's also a 25-50% chance I could pass it on to my baby. Im a nervous wreck and want to see how other mom's are coping with their high risk pregnancy.",
