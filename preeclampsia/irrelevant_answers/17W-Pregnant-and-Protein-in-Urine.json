            "answer": "i had it when i was 35 weeks. i had preeclampsia and had to deliver my daughter via c-sec as soon as it was confirmed by 24 hr urine sample. watch your bp, and you may want to request that they do a 24 hour test. i think a certain amount is OK, which is why they make you do the 24 hour sample if they suspect a problem. It's a slight pain- you have to keep a gigantic jug with your pee in it in your fridge.",
