            "answer": "Ah! Im sorry. I wasnt induced but my labor and delivery was a breeze. Its a good thing to tell yourself that womem were made for this. We can handle it like pros ;) you may have a great labor (induced or not) so think of the bright side! Also ive talked to plenty of girls who said that they had no problem when induced. no matter what its going to be painful but the amazing thing is the pain doesnt last. Soon enough your beautiful baby will be welcomed into the world. Good luck mama. Think positive",

            "answer": "I didnt have preeclampsia but i opted to be induced with my second son for two reasons...1-i was having regular contractions since 19-20 weeks and 2-my kids had the same due date and didnt want them to actually have the same bday...i can say my induction went super smooth and had absolutely no problems...i would say if they deem it medically necessary then opt for it...your body will let you know if something is wrong so if you dont want to be induced then just pay attention to any signs.",

    "question": "I'm almost 38 Weeks pregnant and have been having problems with my blood pressure and pre eclampsia. I've been sent to labor and delivery 3 times this month, twice in the past week to be observed and checked out for pre eclampsia. I go to the doctors twice a week now and everyone I go they send me to the hospital and send me home after a few hours. but the last time they were talking about inducing me or scheduling me to be induced. I know I've thought about it but never really thought about it and now that I'm close I'm terrified of labor. I'm afraid of everything being I'm a ftm. They asked me if I wanted induced and I said not unless I had to be because I've heard its worse but I also scared of labor. sorry so long just need to talk. my SO really doesn't understand what I'm afraid of. You know men!! Lol",
