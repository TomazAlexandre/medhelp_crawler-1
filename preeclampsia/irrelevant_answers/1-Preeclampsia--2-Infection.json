            "answer": "This is my first pregnancy so I can't help too much with the first part of your question.As far as UTIs go you'll most likely know if you have one. They are very uncomfortable. They can manifest in different ways but usually what your looking for is, lower back/flank pain, foul smelling urine (you'd notice), urine that is very cloudy or turbid and darker in color (may even be tinged with red or pink), urination may be painful or uncomfortable, you will feel an urgency to go right after you've just gone, feeling like you have to void a lot and only able to produce a few drops, some women get fevers.As for a yeast infection, many people think an odorous discharge means yeast however when you have a yeast infection usually it will smell almost sweet. (If you've ever baked bread) it takes on a smell of actual yeast. Also the discharge is usually white or very pale yellowish in color and almost resemble cottage cheese. Any discharge that is quite yellow or even greenish in color is most likely a bacterial infection, not yeast. Usually with a yeast infection you'll notice some external itching and redness... Some women do get an odor to their discharge during pregnancy due to hormonal changes so if that's the only symptom you're having you could mention it to your Dr but its most likely within normal pregnancy limits.",

Sorry, I shoulda have mentioned this in the post, but at times I do have slight sharp pains on the left side of my groin area but it happens when I'm not urinating also. And now that you mention the having to go but a few drops only producing, that's happened 2-3 times but it was weeks ago.",

    "question": "1. I'm scared I may have it or may get it. I'm almost certain I had high blood pressure before getting pregnant. But they checked it twice at my last appointment and it barely went down the second time it was checked. But so far I don't have any symptoms that I know of. They took a urine sample and I'm praying nothing bad comes back from the results. Can anyone who has it or has had it give a little detail on what it's like?2. I know UTI's and yeast infections are very common in pregnancies. But I've never had one so I don't know what it's like. I've had no itching or burning, no pain while peeing, and no discolored or clumpy discharge. However, I've noticed that I sometimes have a slight odor down there. But I've also read that some women sometimes have that happen to them while pregnant and there's nothing wrong. I know at my next visit they'll tell me if I have one or they might call. But is it common to not know you may have one?",
