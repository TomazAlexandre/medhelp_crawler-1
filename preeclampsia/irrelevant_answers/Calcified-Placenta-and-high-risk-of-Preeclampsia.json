            "answer": "Yes, I've been/am in a similar situation to you and really want to reassure you. I don't grow very good placentas and as a result have developed preeclamplsia with both of my pregnancies. First time developed it at 28wks and delivered at 35wks when bp stopped responding to meds and baby stopped growing (he only needed 1wk nicu for breathing, feeding and jaundice and you would never know it these days hes such an active 18mth old) and this time developed it at 15wks and am delivering on Friday at 36wks. Hours after my first i fely a lot better and the preeclampsia went away in days, however it is a good idea to check your liver and kidney function a couple of months later due to the strain on your body. It is very scary however the understanding of the condition is a lot better these days and therefore the outcomes for mum and bub are a lot better, 38wks is also a great time to deliver if you have to deliver early. Wishing you and your family all the best!",

            "answer": "Thank you so much! Reading someone's first hand experience has put me at ease quite a bit (which is obviously better for me and bub!) I'm so glad everything went good for you but hate you had to go through it.. all though it's all worth it when baby arrives :) I have a feeling they may induce over the next week as I don't seem to be improving but they will try to get me as far as possible, I've just gotta be very aware and keep track of his movements among other things while I'm not at the doctors .. again, thank you x",

    "question": "Hello lady's. I've been monitored extremely closely the past few days due to the fact I was diagnosed with preeclampsia. They've also just found my placenta isn't doing it's job properly, after having an ultrasound by my doctor, you could see my placenta had white all around and through it. He said this means it is calcified which would help to explain my high BP among other things. Dr is concerned because I am supposed to be 36w6d and bubs stomach is small.. measuring 33w4d but his femur and head are measuring 37w5d.\u00a0\u00a0My partner asked \"Is this bad?\" Doctor said \"It means we have to get bub out as soon as possible but we want to try to get to as close to 38weeks as possible as well.\" (Next Wednesday.) Baby shows no signs of distress, he kicks a lot and is happy but my CTG Scans are also not meeting a criteria they would like. I feel like everything is going wrong, it's very scary on my poor partner and myself.. has anyone else gone through this?",
