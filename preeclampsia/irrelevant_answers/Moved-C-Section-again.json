    "question": "Just talked to special ob and he's convinced that baby needs to be out. I'm due July 25. This pregnancy has been rather terrible and I have been hospitalized 4 times and I do have preeclampsia but I'm scared.\u00a0\u00a0First baby came early and had to stay in hospital 3 weeks. Not the greatest feeling to have to visit your child in NICU seeing all those tubes and her only being 2.4 lbs. He said a week and a half. I'm scared now but that's not to early right??",
