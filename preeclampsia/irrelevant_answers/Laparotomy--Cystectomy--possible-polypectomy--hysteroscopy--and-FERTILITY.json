            "answer": "Hi Cate!That surgery could take 1-2hrs (estimated time) there's prep time included in there. You'll have to stay in recovery for a couple hours at least.\u00a0\u00a0Depending how much is actually done surgically will be one of the depending factors of how long your recovery will take. Sometimes there is a little more they find once they go in.\u00a0\u00a0You will have to ask your doctor if he thinks you will be admitted or going home same day. That may depend on how your feeling post op.\u00a0\u00a0I hope everything goes well for you! When you see your dr for a Pre op maybe ask him some of these questions.\u00a0\u00a0You will feel more settled hearing what his plans are for you.",

            "answer": "Hi Hun.Let me share my experience with you, hope it eases your mind. I just went through this not knowing what to expect, so I would like to help someone else know what will happen during the surgery/after. My doctor was very vague!I just had a laparatomy to remove a dermoid ovarian cyst on my left ovary 2 weeks ago. It turned out that I had two cysts. One on each ovary, they just didnt see the other one on the CAT scan for some reason. Size - 13 cm for one cyst and the other was a size of an orange, so a little smaller. I kept both ovaries and any other parts. They just took out the cysts.The reason they did the laparatomy vs the lap (keyhole surgery where they go into your belly button) was b/c of the size of the cyst. They needed room to be able to take it out. Laparatomy recovery is a little more time vs. the keyhole surgery (lap). This could be the same reason for you.Everyone is different, but my surgery was 1.5 hours and I was in recovery for an hour and a half afterwards. My surgery was at 12pm and by 3pm I was in my room and awake. They did the bikini cut and i had a 4 inch cut there. They did not use staples or stiches, just the dermabond glue. I think it gives you less scarring. I dont know lol I got up and pee'd and ate some graham crackers right away. So that was good, they sent me home that day. I got home and got into bed.They make keep you overnight for observation, but that depends on how you are doing when you wake up. Some people feel naseaus or just not well. You are a lot younger than me, so I hope that you can go home and get rest - rather than stay all night away from your husband and daughter. You should bounce back I am guessing.Some friendly advice is to get up and walk after the surgery, even if its just a few steps, b/c they fill your stomach with gas during the surgery to give them more room to work on you! That is the WORST side effect I think. For me, I didnt know about the gas b/c no one told me at the hospital when I left\u00a0\u00a0and it went up my arm and started hurting my shoulder! So if anything make sure you move around. Also take some of those Gas X Chewable cherry tablets. So just be aware if you start feeling that sharp pain in your shoulder - its gas! you will need to chew those pills, move around, and sip ginger ale. That gas pain *****! lol I hope you don't have it.Once you are home it might take about 6 weeks for the bloating and pain to stop around your incision. I have always had a flat tummy and it looks like i have a \"shelf\" of swelling below my belly button. I am going to my first follow up Dr appt tomorrow so I am going to ask if its normal. I think it is. I tire easily and i take some pain meds at night, when my belly feels most puffy and i have to sleep on my back.\u00a0\u00a0I work from home, so that makes it easier, I sit up with my computer during the day and then lay down at night and watch tv.I do not have any kids yet, but I think you should be safe to start trying for a baby in 6 weeks. You should start your period by then. I am due for mine, but it has not come, probably b/c of the surgery. Everyone is different and heals differently! One thing to know is that this type of surgery is nothing to take lightly. It will zap your energy! Once its over you will feel relief -- its just getting through the first few weeks and not being able to do much.I was gaining a lot of weight b/c of the cysts. I gained 30 lbs in 3 months and I was only eating about 1300 - 1400 calories per day and jogging 5 miles per day / 5 days a week. I knew something was wrong. I hope this weight will come off b/c I have always been active and did not have a weight issue before this.I hope this helps! If you have any questions you can e-mail me here I think offline! Best of luck to you! :-) Let us know on here how it goes!! :-)",

    "question": "I'm 21 y/o, had a terrible time losing weight and conceiving over the last 6 months or so. Conceiving my first daughter, when I was 15 and irresponsible, was so easy, I didn't know that I was pregnant until 17 weeks. Long story short, she passed the day she was born at 27 weeks.My second daughter was much harder to conceive.3 months of not really trying but not preventing and 6 months of actively trying, charting, opk-ing and whatever else I could think of before I finally got pregnant. That pregnancy was ridiculously hard.(The run down-\u00a0\u00a0in case it matters long term. Small for gestational age, quad test came back for increased risk of downs'. 4 inch thick placenta and low fluid throughout. hyperemesis constant, hospitalized for fluids three to four times a week up through week 17 and then only once a week. delivered at 38 weeks 2 days.\u00a0\u00a0Induced because of preeclampsia. In labor 33 hours and ended up having my placenta shredding so they had to \"scoop\" me out. TMI but I couldn't find another way to say it.)Didn't have a period from August to November,and even then they were crazy irregular and hardly a period at all so I went in to have an ultrasound and they found a (little over) 5 cm Bilateral dermoid cyst on R ovary, possible cyst in\u00a0\u00a0the L ovary, and small polyp in the uterine cavity.I got my surgery date (May 6th, 2013 at 9 a.m. & they are doing LAPAROTOMY) I know to be there two hours early, but I'm trying to plan...HERE ARE MY QUESTIONS:How long should I expect my surgery to take (obviously it's not timed but an estimate would be great)Will I be headed home the same day (like a laparoscopy) or should I plan to have my husband go home and take care of our daughter and come back to get me released?How soon after I recover(as I've been told, 30 days) can I expect my cycle to return to somewhat normal, and be able to start trying to conceive?Any help or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!!*Cate",
