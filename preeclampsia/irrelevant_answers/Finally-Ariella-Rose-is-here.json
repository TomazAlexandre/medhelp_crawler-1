    "question": "Ariella Rose is here! 8 lb. 14 ounces 21 inches.I went in to be induced from preeclampsia and ended up going into labor on my own while i was waiting for a bed! thankfully I made it to a bed in time and she came so quickly the doc never made it to the room. A nurse delivered her. I only pushed once. litterally, the nurse came in to see why I was screaming, went to check my cervix- at her touch my water bag exploded all over her- and maybe 10 to 15 seconds later she was out. talk about fast. I was in shock. it was like the kid just fell out of me. even though this was my third baby, I just couldn't believe what was happening to me. I'm glad its over though! she's a princess.",
