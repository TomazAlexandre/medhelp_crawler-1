            "answer": "Not to scare you, but with my first i kept telling my dr i thought i had pre-e (my bp had been high since i was 8 weeks pregnant). I also had swelling, sudden weight gain, headaches, blurry vision, etc. But they kept telling me i was fine. I ended up having two seizures on my due date and an emergency c-section because i had ECLAMPSIA. Yeah...they wouldn't listen to me and it went from pre-e to eclampsia suddenly. I also had pre-e with my 2nd baby. And pregnancy-induced hypertension with my 3rd. Also, the low-birth weight thing with pre-e is not always true. My first baby was 9 lbs 8 oz on my due date, next two were both 3 weeks early and both 8 lbs 3 oz. Like i said, not to scare you, but i wish i had known with my first what i know now. I would have advocated for myself instead of just trusting that my ob knew best. I hope everything works out well for you!",

            "answer": "I feel like my doc isn't taking my past seriously either. My daughter was born at 29 weeks after being incredibly ill my entire pregnancy. It was my first so I wasn't sure if it was normal, I was so sick and had the worst headaches all the time. I threw up so much I popped blood vessels in my face, I was purple and swollen as hell. I gained 90 lbs rapidly. I weighed 122 when I got pregnant and 220 when she was born. She only weighed 1.5lbs and was in the nicu for 3 months. I was also in Germany where no one spoke English and I had no clue what was happening around me. I went to the hospital xmas morning not feeling well, was sent home and ended up back at ER Dec 26th I was then rushed to a hospital 2 hours away put on meds and monitored like crazy then the next day i started having seizures and was told it's baby time, again language barrier sucked, last thing I remember was screaming in pain and an oxygen mask being put on me. Then waking up with a tube down my throat. I was told I had been in a drug induced coma for 2 days and had to have a blood transfusion. I didn't see my daughter for 4 days.now. my blood pressure has been 147/80 twice now at the ER and was sent home like it's nothing....that freaks me the hell out... my normal BP is 110/60... shouldn't they be taking it a little more seriously???",

    "question": "Im 38 weeks. The last 2 times I went to my dr appointment my bp has been 140/86. They did lab work and my lab work came back fine. But yesterday I went back to the dr and it was high again. I got home and wasn't really on my feet and toward the end of the night my feet swelled up like balloons. I couldn't even put my flip flops on. This morning I woke up and my feet are still swollen like that. Is this preeclampsia? My fiancee is freaking out and wants to take me to the hospital but I'm not experiencing any headaches or anything. Just abnormally swollen feet lol",
