            "answer": "Hey, I'm not a doctor, but there are a few things that you can do. You need to monitor your blood pressure levels very often, as well as have your\u00a0\u00a0blood checked for protein level. Limit your salt intake and watch out for foods high in sodium. Drink extra water to try to flush out toxins accumulating in your blood. Try to rest a lot and when you lie down, lie on your left hand side. There is no way to cure your condition until the baby is born. Try to be in contact and dialogue with your doctor very often. I hope things work out for you. Take care.",
