            "answer": "I developed it with my first at 28wks and with this one at 15wks. Its rare to develop before 20wks but it does happen. My dr has been treating it with aspirin and calcium to help blood flow through the placenta for baby and blood pressure meds to keep that symptom managed. Unfortunately there's not alot they can do about the protein as thats more of an indicator of how your liver and kidneys are coping rather then a symptom so they'll keep an eye on that. I delivered my first at 35wks and am delivering this one next week at 36wks so they have been able to manage mine and buy my babies quite a bit of time, however be prepared that you may have a few hospital trips as they try different meds to manage your bp. Wishing you lots of luck!",
