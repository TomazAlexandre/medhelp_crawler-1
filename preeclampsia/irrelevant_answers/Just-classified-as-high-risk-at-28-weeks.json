Sometimes it's difficult to keep to the diet, but if you're doing well keeping your numbers normal you can experiment with food a little. Hopefully you'll be able to control it with diet, just remember it's temporary. As long as you're controlling your sugar levels you shouldn't worry. If not you'll have doctors to help you though! Good luck, that's the only issue I know much about!",

    "question": "We knew at the beginning of the pg I had potential to go high risk as I have high BP that could lead to preeclampsia and a history of gestational diabetes in the family.They've been checking on me more closely for the preeclampsia, but so far that looks good even though my BP is starting to rise.\u00a0\u00a0All my labs there look good.However, after yesterdays appt I have been classified as high risk due to anemia and gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was told I have to start taking extra iron supplements for the anemia and they are referring me to a dietician for the gestational diabetes.Does anybody have any experience with either of these pg complications?",
