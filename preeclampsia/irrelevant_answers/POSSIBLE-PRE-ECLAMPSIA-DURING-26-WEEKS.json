            "answer": "I'm currently 24 weeks pregnant with twins.\u00a0\u00a0I have been experiencing blood pressure that has gone up and down, and only recently been experiencing swelling of ankles and hands.\u00a0\u00a0Every time I go to the doctor, I only have a trace of protein in the urine.\u00a0\u00a0However, my OB/gyn sent me to have monitoring at the hospital clinic to rule out pre-eclampsia last Friday.\u00a0\u00a0I had a 24 hour urine collection to see how much protein was in the urine, (anything over 300 is too high)\u00a0\u00a0bloodwork with a full panel and liver workup, and hooked to fetal monitors for almost four hours to make sure the babies heart rates were ok with my blood pressure fluctuating.\u00a0\u00a0Everything came back ok for me, but this was precautionary in my case and may be repeated later if my symptoms do not go away.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to suggest that your doctor run some additional tests, at least to give you peace of mind.\u00a0\u00a0If you do the 24 hour urine collection, you will know for you sure the protein level and whether or not you are going into pre-eclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0I know how scary it sounds and you're definitely doing everything you can by getting lots of rest and eating a low salt diet.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and keep us posted!",

            "answer": "I have chronic hypertension so have been given lots of information on hypertension in pregnancy and am being monitored for preeclampsia as I have a 1 in 4 risk of it due to the pre-existing BP problems. I've had no problems so far - actually my BP has dropped and I am on quarter of my normal BP meds which they say is normal for 2nd trimester. From all the information I have it seems that it would be rare that pre-eclampsia is starting this early on but who knows.You might like to rent a BP testing kit to have at home for reassurance. You can then take your BP every day at the same time and see if it goes up. Then there isn't a panic if it is high at the doctors as sometimes it is higher at Dr's purely due to worry and the rushing around to get to appointments. Then take your record of your home test results in to discuss with the Dr.As for the protein, since it has been high twice I would strongly urge you to request a 24hr urine protein test. However typically with Pre-eclampsia the protein indicates that the high bloodpressure is affecting your kidneys so you would see the protein once you have already noticed your BP climbing.Protein can be present for a range of other reasons / conditions too. For example, if you have changed your diet and taken alot more dairy products it can elevate as well as if you are having problems with vomiting or other things going on affecting your diet and nutrient absorption (e.g gestational diabetes). Also if you go to your checkup first thing verses later in the day when you have had your bladder sitting full during the night it can be high. The 24hr collection may best show what the true situation is, rather than it being a one time snapshot in a month.Best of luck with the appointment today.",
