    "question": "At the end of March, I started having elevated blood pressure, but then it went back into the normal range. Two weeks ago, it was 148/92 so my doctor had me do a 24 hour urine sample. My levels didn't come back high enough to diagnos me with preeclampsia but he said they were a little abnormal so he had me start doing NST twice a week. Everything has been good, except for Thursday when baby and I had high heart rates but I had gotten a cold and after doing some test and baby's heart rate going back in normal range, they said everything was okay. My feet have been on and off swelling ever since my blood pressure has been elevated, but this morning after waking up, my right hand felt really tight so I held it out and it's really swollen. My fingers not so much, and my left hand looks like it may have very slight swelling. Should I go into L&D? This is the first time this has happened.",
