    "question": "37 weeks and 3 days and just found out I have preeclampsia and I will be delivering this weekend/early next week. I don't know how to feel less stressed and keep calm. I wish the father was here in her life, and my life for comfort but that's not the case.. Anyone else ever gone through this? I am a first time mom, doing it all on my own. Any tips to stay less stressed as possible?",
