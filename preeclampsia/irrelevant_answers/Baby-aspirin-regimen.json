            "answer": "That's what I'm seeing when I Google it - seems like baby aspirin is generally considered to have no negative impacts and may have multiple benefits, I guess I'd you have any high risk factors. I don't have any history of miscarriage but did have some trouble getting pregnant (tried for 2 years).I'm nervous about preeclampsia because my SIL almost died after her doctor missed the diagnosis. Nice to see continued research in this area - I just wish I'd known to take it during the fertility treatments since it seems to show some benefits in helping you get pregnant!",

    "question": "Hi ladies - I'm 38 and will be 9 weeks pregnant tomorrow. It took several rounds of IUI fertility treatments (6) to get me here and as soon as I started having symptoms at 4 weeks, fertility doc said to start a baby aspirin regimen. Looking into it, it seems like relatively new research revealing many benefits in women over 35, particularly reduced risk of pre-eclampsia among other things.Just wondering if anyone else is doing this? My friends with babies hadn't heard about it. I'm not high risk for any reason besides \"advanced maternal age,\" as they so delightfully refer to it.",
