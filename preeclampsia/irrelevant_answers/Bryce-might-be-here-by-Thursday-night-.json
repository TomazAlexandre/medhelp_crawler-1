            "answer": "Now I need help/advice. First of all TMI alert.... So about the time I posted last night I started having really bad lower back pain that lead to like 3 or 4 contractions. It took forever to fall alseep I was hurting really bad. Well this morning my bad just aches, nothing like last night and the inside of my hips/ legs are really sore. Tmi part, I have also been have diarriah(sp?) this morning. Actually the last 2 days i've been having a lot more bowel movements but today was that. Is labor on it's way? Should I just tell my dr I don't want the amnio and give it a few more days? Or could labor still be a week or more away? I know they want to do the amnio but if he is coming on his own anyway, why put myself through it? Amber, you had it, was it bad? I'm just so confused now.....",

            "answer": "Basically my ob said so that it could be scheduled at the hospital, I would have to wait till next week for the amnio then go in for the induction. Well they will be inducing me the following Monday anyway so what's the point. So we are now back at square one, waiting and I will not be going back to EITHER of these two drs.... They played he said she said and avoided me till the day was over, I didn't get my call backs till after hours, and until then, I didn't know they were wanting to wait till next week, I thought I was suppose to be going in yesterday. *sigh* not much I can do now but wait for him to come and deal with all the backache and annoying contractionsthanks for asking!! How's your sweet one doing?",

    "question": "So I went to the Perinatologist today and again, my BP was high so they took blood (I have been ordered to do a 24 hour urine collect from my OB to which I will be doing Thursday and turning it in Friday) well they decided today that thy want to do an amnio tomorrow to see if his lungs are developed and if they are, I head in to the hospital Thursday to be induced. They are worried that even though I may not be showing signs of preeclampsia or have it showing in my test, they don't want it to develop in between testing so they figure it's best doing it this way.In the mean time, I have been having more bowel movements today (TMI- and they are getting looser) and been having more contractions. They didn't check me today but they told me that his head is engaged and I have thinned out enough to feel his head. They said everything sounds good that he could be here by the weekend!!I need prayers that his lungs are developed (I have FULL faith that the Lord has him ready for us) and prayers that labor goes smooth and quick. I can't wait to get the results of the amnio, and even more to meet my son!!!!!!!",
