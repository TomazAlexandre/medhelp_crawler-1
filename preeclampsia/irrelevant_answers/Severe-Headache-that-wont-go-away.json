            "answer": "All of this can be related to your kidney problem. As far as your headache goes, it sounds as if you have a tension headache which can be from all of symptoms you have been having. Especially because you are pregnant you are more likely to become worried and more stressed. Tension headaches can also be caused during pregnancy due to back pain. Being exhausted, and feeling weak, as well as your stomach problem can all be related to your pregnancy. I suggest taking prenatal pills, and trying to get as much nutrients as possible because remember, your sharing them now! :)",

    "question": "I am a 20yr old female and I am currently 24 weeks pregnant. I was in the hospital three days ago because I have been having problems with kidney stones. The day before yesterday I began feeling very sick to my stomache, tired, and noticed a headache starting in the very base of my head. Thinking i was coming down with a cold, i took over the counter cold medicine, used a ice pack on my neck and went to sleep. This has been my routine since it started, and my headache has only gotten worse, and the nausea has turned into severe vomiting. I feel incredibly weak and have a very bad trembling in my arms and upper body. I have increased my water intake and even pain medicine that I was given for my kidney stones does not help in the least bit. I called the triage nurse and she told me i had the flu and to drink water. I am at my whits end at this point. I can barely keep anything down, am unable to sleep for very long, and i get exausted getting up to get a drink. PLEASE HELP!!! Is there something else i can try? what should I do at this point?P.S. my pregnancy has been fantastic, and i am negative for gestastional diabetes, and preeclampsia, and the baby is still moving very well. I have also had 6 nosebleeds since yesterday. even with the use of vaseline in my nostrils and a humidifieer",
