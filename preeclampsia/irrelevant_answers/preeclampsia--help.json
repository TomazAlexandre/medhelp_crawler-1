            "answer": "Im a NICU nurse and have been in delivery rooms with women who have preclampsia. Having high protein in your urine can be caused by anything. If your urine is very dark you could also be dehydrated. Try drinking a couple glasses of water. Preclampsia can be dangerous for both you and baby. What happens is your blood pressure and heart rate will increase and your baby's heart rate will become increased as well. In some cases doctors don't see a huge concern if everything is border line. If the doctor isn't too concerned about it just drink plenty of fluids and healthy foods. If the doctor thought it was that extreme to both of you you would have been enduised to make sure you and the baby are not harmed. You can call your doctor andbrequest more info. If he tells you he's not too concerned with it because you are border line for it. Take it easy and don't stress yourself out. Best of luck!!",
