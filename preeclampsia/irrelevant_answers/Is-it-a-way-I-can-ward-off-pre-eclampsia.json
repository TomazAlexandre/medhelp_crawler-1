            "answer": "I don't think there's anything you can do to prevent since no one knows exactly what causes it.But, if take preventative measures against the things they think might contribute to preeclampsia... Cut back on salt and fatty foods, light exercises to help prevent the high BP. Severe gum disease is also thought to have something to do with it, so see your dentist and take good care of your mouth. My doctor even suggested I take Emergen-C to help care for my gums. I also read vitamin d deficiency could be a factor, so maybe talk to your doctor about adding some extra d supplement along with your prenatal vitamin.I've just been diagnosed with preeclampsia so I've been reading about it a lot. Fortunately for me I'm late in my pregnancy so I can just deliver early. I hope you find a solution or at least a way to keep it at bay.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "So I found out its a girl...everytime I been pregnant with a girl aat the end of my pregnancy I always end up getting induced because my blood pressure got high enough for seizures. When I have a boy I never got it. My last girl baby it was so bad to the point I was so swolen tech had a hard time trying to get epidural in so I had to go without and have a huge mark on my back as a token. Is it anything I can do to not get preeclampsia? My blood pressure now @ 20weeks is and has been fine but I know how that changes.",
