            "answer": "TSH is a pituitary signal for the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormone. Yours is low so this means that you have enough available thyroid hormone or maybe even a little to much. But when I look at your actual thyroid hormones-they are all about mid range so nothing jumping out here to say you may be hyperthyroid (too much thyroid hormone). However, your doctor did not test the Freet3 and this tells us more info then Total t3 which is out dated in my opinion.Free means availabe for uptake into the cells. Total is already bound to proteins in the blood. Doesn't tell us as much. Atleast he did the fret4 though. Your vitamin D is low- needs to be around 50 or 60 so I'd begin takinig atleast 2000 iu D3 per day. My daughter and I take 5000 each evening after dinner as this is best for absorbtion. Are you having ant symptoms of hyper or hypo. thyroidism?",
