            "answer": "Stay strong! My first one was born at 28 weeks due to severe preeclampsia.I'm 33 weeks pregnant with the 2nd baby now. So far everything has been fine thank God!! I've been seeing a high risk doctor in addition to OB though. He has me taking flex seed oil, 1500ml of calcium, and baby aspirins + prenatals every day. Said they've done studies and saw positive results.Check with your doctor too if they haven't told you to take these yet. I know its scary. I just try not to think about it too much and take it week by week. Every new week for me is a win!Just stay positive but in case something happens, I've seen babies in NICU who were born even at 24-25 weeks and have made it out ok!",

            "answer": "I have been pregnant 5 times. The first time, I got preeclampsiya at 21 weeks. They had to deliver so needless to say baby didn't have a chance. My next pregnancy I got preeclampsiya at 36 weeks. Delivered at 37 weeks. She is now 9 years old. 3rd pregnancy no preeclampsiya but the placenta was insufficient with blood flow to the baby. 4th was perfect and 5th has been perfect. Chin up and try not to worry. Every pregnancy is different. Just keep all appointments with your dr.",
