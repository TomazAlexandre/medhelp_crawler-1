            "answer": "I have not experienced Preeclampsia, but I've experienced being labeled high risk since 26 weeks, and I can tell you that if you are high risk to where they want or need to monitor you more frequently, you may be hospitalized. I was hospitalized and have been since (now 31 weeks). They may want you also on strict bed rest, meaning only up to go to the bathroom, and showering can also now become a luxury depending what they feel your restrictions should be. I'm not sure what they would do strictly due to preeclampsia, but they will be trying their best to keep baby where it should be as long as they can. So be prepared for the boredom that may ensue! It's well worth it though. Best of wishes to you!",
