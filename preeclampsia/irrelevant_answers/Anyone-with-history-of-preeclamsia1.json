I'm 11+1 with number three pregnancy second baby. Lower your sodium AND caffeine. That will also help your blood pressure. I'm also taking a baby aspirin each day with my prenatal and folic acid. Drink as much water as you can stand. That will also help to flush your system of bad stuff. Intake my BP a couple times a day, when I remember. Lie down for a little while if it gets elevates and raise those feet.I hope you get your vbac!",

    "question": "I had to have my first baby at 28 weeks due to preeclamsia which apparently started around 24 weeks, but we didn't catch it until 28 weeks.. Now, I'm 14 weeks pregnant with my second baby. OB told me to be taking aspirin every day to reduce the risks of repeating it.I've been feeling fine so far but lately started having headaches here and there. One day my blood pressure was elevated as well.Has anyone had preeclampsia before? What's your experience like with the next pregnancy?I'm 30 and had 8 months between pregnancies. My first was born via c-section but I want to try vbac this time..",
