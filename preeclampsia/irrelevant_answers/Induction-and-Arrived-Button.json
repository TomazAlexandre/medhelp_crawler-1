I also found out my induction date which will be exactly one week from today on Aug. 6 at midnight due to preeclampsia (I've been at the hospital on bed rest for about a week and a half) which is also my sisters birthday! So I get to push my button really soon. So excited, everything seems to be happening so fast all of a sudden. Can't wait to meet my princess! :)",
