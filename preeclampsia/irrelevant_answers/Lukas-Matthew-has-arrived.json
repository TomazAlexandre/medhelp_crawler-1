We had a tough time deciding, but chose Owen because it's less popular than Alexander. We'll see though!",

    "question": "Lukas arrived at a little over 37 weeks on Wed night at 11:58!\u00a0\u00a0It was a bit of a surprise but a good one.\u00a0\u00a0I woke up that morning with cramps.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed that my plug was coming out and continued to all day so I figured it may be soon.\u00a0\u00a0Then again people tell me they walk around like that for weeks so you never know.\u00a0\u00a0My cramps got really bad so I called my doctor to see me instead of the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't want to go for 6 hrs for them to send me home.\u00a0\u00a0When he checked me I was 3-4 and said I needed to be a solid 4 to send me in labor for my c section.\u00a0\u00a0He told me to walk around and come back in a couple hours.\u00a0\u00a0I walked around downtown Disney (really bad idea since it was like 100 out) and went back.\u00a0\u00a0No change so he sent me home with muscle relaxers and told me to take them and take a nap.\u00a0\u00a0He said either I would wake up in pain and it would be true labor or it would all go away.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say I got home and fell asleep and didn't pick up my prescription.\u00a0\u00a0When I woke up my cramps had gone away a bit.\u00a0\u00a0An hour later I realized I hadn't felt him move at all since before my nap so I took and shower and told my husband I wanted to get checked.\u00a0\u00a0On the way to the hospital my contractions came back.\u00a0\u00a0I got there around 9pm and I was 4 cm!!!!!!!\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately my labor progressed quickly and I couldn't get anything for the pain until right before my section.\u00a0\u00a0They were waiting on my platelet count to come back because I may have developed preeclampsia at that point and wanted to make sure my count was high enough before giving me a needle in my spine.\u00a0\u00a0Finally at about 11:30 they took me back and he was born at 11:58.\u00a0\u00a0He is (or was) 8lbs and 20 inches long.\u00a0\u00a0He is perfect and looks just like Ayden.\u00a0\u00a0He nurses like a champ and had no problems latching.\u00a0\u00a0My mom wasn't planning on coming down until next Friday and my mother in law was away on business so it was just me and Matt.\u00a0\u00a0Compared to my entire experience with Ayden my whole birthing experience this time was absolutely perfect from start to finish.\u00a0\u00a0It was nice with just Matt and I.\u00a0\u00a0This time all the nurses were wonderful and he went straight from the OR to recovery with me.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't see Ayden for 8 hours after birth.\u00a0\u00a0Last night my mother in law bought me a full body massage right in my room and my husband and I a four course gormet dinner.\u00a0\u00a0Then I was discharged and out the door less than 48 hours after he was born.\u00a0\u00a0I got home and my friend had cleaned and organized my entire house for me.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday was the best day ever!\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately shortly after Lukas was born I recieved a phone call that my grandmother had passed unexpectantly.\u00a0\u00a0I was devestated.\u00a0\u00a0I am closer to her than anyone I know.\u00a0\u00a0I just wish she had found out about Lukas.\u00a0\u00a0The services are Monday and Tuesday in Massachusetts so there is no way I can go.\u00a0\u00a0I just have to believe that she is watching over him right now and maybe thats why he was born early.Sorry this is so long.\u00a0\u00a0I just wanted to share with everyone!!",
