            "answer": "Thank you so much for sharing. This made me cry, but the tears were hopeful ones. I'm 26 and just lost my first baby. I was so devastated because we go pregnant with the first try and were so excited. I am very thankful I don't have the complications that you did, but did have my thyroid checked afterwards since there is a history of hypothyroidism in my family. Luckily the test came out normal. I'm very anxious to try again and while I'm so sorry to hear about all your complications I do have a lot more hope and am praying that I can enjoy my next pregnancy. Thanks again.To LilTq: I admire your persistence and I'm so sorry that you have experienced so many miscarriages. How do you deal with the depression?",

And i also take anti depressants after a miscarriage, i do have a really hard time dealing with it but i just keep praying that ill get another baby someday. I've learned not to be too hopeful or excited while pregnant it helps with the disappointment and hurt. I'm still fighting. And no one should lose\u00a0\u00a0hope because it can happen this group has really helped me with worrying while pregnant and coping with the losses.",

    "question": "I came to medhelp for other reasons but found this forum and wanted to share. I've read so many posts and even though it's been several years, it feels just like yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0It started w/my first unexpected pregnancy. My husband (at the time) and I were not planning on having children, the good news was my tubes were blocked so I had free birth control, or so I thought. It took a couple years but one day it happened. guess I didn't need the medical procedure to take care of the tubes, they did so all on their own. My first pregnancy helped me realize I did want a child/children. However, not too far into my pregnancy I had a couple small spots of blood. I contacted my OB and we discovered my HCG levels had dropped. I was informed the pregnancy was not viable and a d & c was suggested. I waited and prayed. I didn't bleed anymore but after ultra sounds and more bloodwork I accepted the results. My OB was great & didn't wait to send me to a specialist. He did the works to see what could be the problem. I did have a borderline ANA test while in my 1st pregnancy as well as very low progesterone. I had further testing done to rule out lupus. This was rulled out, all other tests except progesterone and some endometriosis were fine so I started medication and trying again. I became pregnant again very fast, started progesterone and prayed. It started out great, but again HCG levels dropped. I'm told I'm having another miscarriage.\u00a0\u00a0This is 2nd pregnancy and the Dr. says we can keep trying, eventually it will work. We go through the 3rd and then 4th pregnancy and loss. My 4th\u00a0\u00a0was with at least twins due to the medication and by far the worst.\u00a0\u00a0I knew as soon as I became pregnant that I was. I notified the Dr. asap so I could start the progesterone, he did a test & it was negative. I waited a couple more weeks, test again and it's positive. The roller coaster has started again. This time I start bleeding again and my levels drop again. We are having another miscarriage. This one took a while to pass, was over Thanksgiving and I had decided it would be my last attempt. Obviously so much more but trying to keep this short. I lost all the weight I'd gained during our fertility treatment, I also lost my marriage, got a dog and started life over as the best auntie there ever was.\u00a0\u00a0A couple years later I met a new person, after a night out and a couple b52's, we didn't take the time to use protection. I knew right away I was pregnant. I didn't want to go through another miscarriage, but I knew it was a matter of time. I didn't go to the Dr. right away, I just tried to ignore it and wait. I waited and waited. I broke down and called my OB. She confirmed I was pregnant and told me I had to go back to the specialist. I refused. I wasn't going to start this all over again. I did very little outside of the norm. I got on the progesterone and for the first time started baby aspirin (due to that borderline positive ana test I had).I didn't stress and soon enough I started to bleed. I knew it was another miscarriage. I notified my OB who scheduled an ultrasound. I didn't stop bleeding but I didn't have a full out miscarriage. I was going to cancel the ultrasound the day of, but decided I'd go. I showed up and we got started. This was the first pregnancy where we found a heartbeat, we also saw the baby and in a seperate area the area that was causing me to bleed and clot. Still bleeding but levels climbing. I went through weekly ultrasounds, but didn't get my hopes up and neither did my OB, to this day we don't know how she survived. As the weeks went by I would bleed on & off, have an ultrasound and all showed good. I still was not accepting that I was pregnant because that would have been too much. I was told at 14 weeks that I was having a girl. I cryed and that was when I accepted that I may actually have a baby. I decided at this point, that when I was bleeding I was staying home from work. I had never done that because most Dr.'s say it does no good. So as the weeks went by I was home a lot. I was put on bedrest the last 3 months due to preeclampsia. When I was at term I had to have a c-section due to many reason but after that I was holding my little baby girl. We are still shocked that I carried to term. God has blessed me and I'm greatfull every day for my daughter.\u00a0\u00a0I know going through a miscarriage or multiple is devastating. I guess I wanted to share this in hopes it may help anyone, even just a little. I was blessed with my one and only and can't have more but that's ok, I have my miracle!\u00a0\u00a0I wish you all the best and my prayers are with you while you go through this.The most important thing I learned in all I went through is to follow your gut. If you don't agree with your Dr. tell them or find a new one, if you think something will help, do it. I did that with my 5th pregnancy and that was the only time.",
