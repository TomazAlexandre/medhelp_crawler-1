            "answer": "This far in your pregnancy it's normal to swell....your body is retaining water because it knows what its about to go through. But some things you can do is pay close attention to your salt intake, watch out for lunch meats and canned foods. Make sure to drink lots of water, and try to rest a little more through out the day. When you get home and kick back to relax put your feet up with a pillow or something under them, it will help the swelling.",

            "answer": "I've been told it's normal.. I've gone up 2 shoe sizes and my wedding band doesn't make it past my knuckle anymore. :( normally if you have preclampsia the swelling is sudden, you may also get high blood pressure and by testing your irons I think there's a sign also. Unfortunately I pass everything with flying colors and still swell. So they aren't concerned. If you are, ask your doc and they'll let you know.",

    "question": "So im 37w6d and the past two days ivr noticed at night when i take my shoes and socks off my feet were swollen and i could hardly see my ankles. The first night when i took my socks off the swelling went down shortly and right now i just took my socks off and im just waiting to see if they unswell. Do you think it could just be from wearing socks and being on my feet all day? Ive had a band around my ankle that you can tell where my sock was. Or do you think it could be a sign of preeclampsia? Or would my doctor have noticed if i had it",
