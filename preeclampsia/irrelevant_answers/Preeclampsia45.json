            "answer": "I have it. Last pregnancy I got it at 28wks, this time from 15wks. Its rare to occur before 20wks but it does happen. Try not to read too much on the net because there are a lot of horror stories that will freak you out. Just relax, drink lots of water and keep that blood pressure down! I got to 35wks with my first and am still aiming for 36wks with this one. Don't be surprised if your dr puts you on calcium, aspirin and a low-fat diet, it will all help keep baby in there and keep you healthy. Take care!",
