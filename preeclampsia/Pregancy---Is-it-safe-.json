            "answer": "Hello,Your blood pressure should improve over time, but it may take a few more weeks.\u00a0\u00a0For many reasons it sounds like it is much, much too early to start trying to conceive again (medically and emotionally) as you suggest you have yet to properly mourn the loss of this most recent pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest you talk with your ob/gyn and ask them about available counseling.\u00a0\u00a0If you are involved in a particulary religious faith, now is the time to turn to a chaplain/rabbi/imam/etc for support.My condolences,Dr. Downing",

    "question": "After one year of trying to conceive\u00a0\u00a0I became pregnant with my 1st child. I had an early delivery (c-section) at 24 wks. The baby passed away because I developed preeclampsia. Now at 6 wks later my B/P is still a little high 150/105, im on meds to control it and cholesterol. (I never had these problems before the baby)\u00a0\u00a0I think I just started my regular period today.My spouse and I would like to try again in a few weeks. Is it too soon? I'm not sure where I am with it.....not sure if\u00a0\u00a0we are trying to replace the baby we lost? Or am I depressed? Is it okay to try right now.....will the blood pressure remain high? Will I feel okay again? We don't talk about what happen to our baby or anything. I dont want to think about it at all. Is that normal......should we try again?I am returning to work on Monday but I am terrified of going back. I don't know how I will interact if I am asked about what happened, etc. I feel I want to get away from everything that remind me of my last pregancy. I don't think this is healthy thinking how can I change from feeling this way?",
