            "answer": "Hi...I am not a doctor, but I pretty much know everything about Type 1 Diabetes. I am a Type 1 Diabetic and am now 34 years old. I have two little ones as well (4 year old girl and 21 month old boy). My biggest fear is for one of them to get my Disease. I have had extensive conversations with my Endocronologist (She is one of my closest friends), so I know she tells me stuff \u201coff the record\u201d. From reading you case, I do not see any indication of Diabetes (Thirst and urination go hand in hand, and also accompany many illnesses). When you are sick or have a lot of health issues you crave extra fluids and the more you drink the more you have to \u201cGo\u201d. Those are the only real indications of Diabetes that I see in your case. If you want to rule it out all you need to do is a simple finger ***** test to test the level of sugar in the blood. Your pediatrician or any doctor can do the test. As a mother I would do it just to rule it out, but as for the symptoms I want you to know that it doesn\u2019t seem like your little one has Type 1 Diabetes (For a little peace of mind)! It just sound like she has several allergy problems. I am sorry, it is had enough having a healthy child...Hang in there, This too shall pass........",
