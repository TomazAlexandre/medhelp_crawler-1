When she was diagnosed we did not have insurance or anything of that matter, we were waiting untill open enrollment at work to apply. Now we have approximently $53,000 in medical bills that we cannot pay for. We have applied for MediCal and have been denied because we have too much property value (one vehicle worth $4,000) which puts us way over the limit to get coverage. Not only that when my wife spoke to the social worker and said how are we supposed to pay this her reply was \"Well, thats not my problem.\" What kind of state agencies are these? They are supposed to be helping people in need and they deny all of the hard working middle class people that pays all of the taxes, yet gives it to everyone that lies, cheats and steals! Does anyone know of any other agencies or programs that my be able to help other than social services? Currently we have been denied everything by the state. Is there not another helping hand?",

My son has had type 1 for 12 years, never had an admittance to a hospital since his diagnosis, but his medical bills are $2000 per month with supplies, pump, high blood pressure meds, cholesterol meds, etc.\u00a0\u00a0We have been lucky with insurance so far picking up most of that, BUT he will not be able to be covered after he is 25.\u00a0\u00a0This is a crisis.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to study the above comments to look for answers.\u00a0\u00a0Those of you who have newly diagnosed little ones, start saving and hold on to your hats.\u00a0\u00a0We have felt very unprepared by our diabetes \"teams\" for the realities of the costs and the toll of the disease on the body even in well-controlled diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I guess we were naive and foolish enough to just hope for the best.",

            "answer": "I am a type 1 diabetic and have been for 18 years, I was diagnosed when I was 9 years old. Growing up I never have had the problems that I currently face with trying to get medicine month to month. This last June my 3 year old daughter was also diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (which was my worst nightmare for my kids to get it) and she has adapted very well to the change because she has to do the same thing that daddy has always done. When she was diagnosed we did not have insurance or anything of that matter, we were waiting untill open enrollment at work to apply. Now we have approximently $53,000 in medical bills that we cannot pay for. We have applied for MediCal and have been denied because we have too much property value (one vehicle worth $4,000) which puts us way over the limit to get coverage. Not only that when my wife spoke to the social worker and said how are we supposed to pay this her reply was \"Well, thats not my problem.\" What kind of state agencies are these? They are supposed to be helping people in need and they deny all of the hard working middle class people that pays all of the taxes, yet gives it to everyone that lies, cheats and steals! Does anyone know of any other agencies or programs that my be able to help other than social services? Currently we have been denied everything by the state. Is there not another helping hand?",
