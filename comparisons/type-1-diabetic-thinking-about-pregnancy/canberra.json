I am trying hard to keep perfect control, but sometimes my blood sugars seem to do thier own thing!! I was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid 6 years ago, at the same time as my diabetes, and have been on medication for it ever since. I will have it checked again.I have not been increasingly stressed or noticed any change in my routine lately....and I got off my BC about 4 months ago. I DID notice a change when I did that and had to adjust my basal rate settings.I am concerned that if I am pregnant having these strange blood sugars while I am will hurt my baby. Any advice?I also kind-of hope these changes ARE because I'm pregnant, because otherwise there is really no reason for them, and that scares me.",
