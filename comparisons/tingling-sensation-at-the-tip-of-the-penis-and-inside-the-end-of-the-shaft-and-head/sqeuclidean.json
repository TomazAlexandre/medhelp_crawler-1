Some other causes which can present with penile tingling esp. at the tip of penis are gonorrhea, Chlamydia( less likely in your case if you are not sexually active), dermatitis, bacterial urethritis and diabetes. Since you have had an attck of UTI, so definitely urtehritis needs to be evaluated by taking a clean catch sample or mid stream sample. Other causes are peripheral neuropathy, peripheral nerve trauma, nerve entrapment or neurological causes.You need to consult a urologist and get your blood sugar levels done. All these possibilities also need to be ruled out one by one. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and regards.",

I'll have to visit my Family doctor next week.Sir, is it possible that there could be Prostatitis? I read that Urine stream could be clear of infection unless Prostatitis spreads to bladder. Is this correct? Will a Digital Rectum Exam reveal presence/absence of Prostatitis? I have no pain during urination or ejaculation. I could see no traces of blood in my urine. This is something which I want to discuss with my doctor. But I'll suggest to get my blood sugar level checked and also discuss possible nerve issues.",
