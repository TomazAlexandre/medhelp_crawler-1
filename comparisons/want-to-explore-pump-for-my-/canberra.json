            "answer": "I have been a diabetic for almost 13 years now. i found out when i was nine years old and when i was thirteen i got on the insulin pump. It has worked great for me. It has helped my A1c tremendously. I am a pretty bad diabetic and was on about 60 Units a day which equaled out to about 8 shots and it was still hard to control at night time. But it is very expensive i have insurance but the insurance only covers supplies it did not cover my insulin pump itself (which was about $3000.00) but it is worth every penny to me. And you would deffinately still need to check blood sugars regularly still at first you would need to check them a little more often to make sure everything is going ok with the pump and it is right for your son.",
