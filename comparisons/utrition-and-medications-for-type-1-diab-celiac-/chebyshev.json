            "answer": "Due to the fact you do have numerous issues; the simplest way to help these issues and follow diets for them is the combine the diets. A moderate fat diet needs to be the base diet which helps your diabetes, heart, GERD, hypertension, liver, and some kidney issues. Moderate fat diet means = use polyunsaturated (omega 3, corn oil, nuts, etc) fats and monounsaturated (olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, etc) fats, no saturated fats (high fat snack foods, butter, fat spreads) and no trans fats. Eat low fat meats (chicken, fish, loin of pork) or non-meat sources (soy products, nuts), low fat vegetarian combinations (rice & beans, pasta (sub pasta for you) & beans, low fat cheese & sub-pasta), low fat dairy products or substitute dairy products (low fat soy milk/soy yogurt), use plant oils, non trans-fat margarines, and eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. From there you need to look at different food groups to take care of your other issues. For Celiac disease substitute all the wheat products for corn or rice products. For Kidney issues, the high potassium fruit and vegetables need to be avoided and substitute with low potassium fruit, such as apples, pears. Tomatoes are high potassium, which needs to be avoided and that will help you with your GERD because tomato products irritate GERD. If you need to limit protein intake due to your kidney state then keep your meat group intake down to the amount of protein grams allowed. Suggest going to a Registered Dietitian to help you with meal planning so you will not be overwhelmed. Hope this helped you.",
