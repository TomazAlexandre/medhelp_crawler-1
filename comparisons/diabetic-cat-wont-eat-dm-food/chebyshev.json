I just did a curve, and her glucose is on the low side, from 73 in the morning and then peaking to 140 and down to 93 later in the day.\u00a0\u00a0It almost seems like she should be hypoglycemic from these scores, but she's the opposite, feeling great and playful.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe the meter is off. I've watched her all night to make sure she's okay.\u00a0\u00a0 I will be calling the Vet hospital as soon as it opens.",
