I have read numerous threads on here explaining how safe condom protected sex is. I have never had a std and this is a new experience for me. I started to question whether or not the condom started to slip up my penis or other ridiculous events. However, I filled the condom with water after to look for leaks.....nothing. I was afraid that the condom just didn't work appropriately. I know it is just anxiety speaking. Thank you for all you guys do. THis forum is extremely helpful.",
