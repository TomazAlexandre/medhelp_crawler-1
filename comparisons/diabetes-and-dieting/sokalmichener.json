Keep your chin up! It will happen, but it does take work.Exercise as much as you can. Walking is great, so even if you cannot get to a gym a brisk walk for about 30-50 minutes atleast 4 times a week will help tremendously.I know this will cost but it may be worth it: many of my friends and patients have had great success with formal programs like Weight Watchers, so if it is an option I would encourage you to look into those.There are diet medications that are approved for use, but they have potential side effects that need to be considered(and still need you to follow diet plans etc). Ask you doctor about Meridia and Orlistat. Alli is now in stores and over the counter, so you can check into that as well.And definitely, stress does make things worse. It is tough with a little one regardless, and your situation has some additional challenges. Breathe, and try as best you can. erelax when the opportunity, no matter how rare, comes your way.Good luck and take care. You are doing great.",
