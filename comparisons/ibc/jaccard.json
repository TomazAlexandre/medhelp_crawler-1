            "answer": "Thank you very much, Dr. Nicolson, for answering my question in the manner you did.It is probably not proper to say more, but after I looked at your web site, a question posted there inspired me to ask you another question, or maybe I should call it sharing an observation with you.I have read repeatedly, that most chemotherapy is not very effective in treating brain tumors/brain mets as it does not cross the blood brain barrier. I should add that all my doctors have over the past 2-3 become very impressed how well I am able to process my body both objectively/subjectively and tell them what will later show on a scan or blood test to be true. They used to think what I had to say was merely a feeling, but it is not as I can interpret and watch and tell quite objectively what is going on as this is my body. in terms of my cancer, it presents itself similar to a fetus does during pregnancy. It is both obvious and 'loud'. (fighting, kicking, moving, circles and colors forming around where it is at) the tumor was 10 by 8 cm at the time of diagnosis and I had drawn a picture of it, then cut this out, and handed it to my oncologist. The dimensions I provided him with of my cutout were exactly the same measurements as the CT had documented.My point, and I would love your opinion on this.I felt my cancer hitting my brain. My spine felt like it does to be in back labor, and then I felt it traveling up the spine into the back of my head. My memory had turned very bad, seriously and differently bad than 'normal bad'. i.e. I was unable to remember if I took my insulin and a couple of times I injected double or even triple amounts and then had to 'eat for my life'. These experiences were scary.During full brain radiation and for two weeks after, my memory improved and then went downhill again.For the past eight weeks, I have been treated with Abraxane for liver mets and I feel 100% better. but what I wanted to point out is that my brain function, my thinking, my memory also has taken a significant turn for the better. So much better that not only I notice it.I therefore believe that the Abraxane is responsible for this improvement as the two started at the same time.Do you believe that the Abraxane is possibly doing what I think it is and really treating the brain lesions as well?Thank you so much for considering my words but I understand if you do not answer. Thanks again, KATRIN",
